  The first step in the process of reproduction is the fusion between the sperm and the egg or egg in a male and a female are called fertilisation
 The first step in the process of reproduction is the fusion of a sperm and an ovum
 Thousands to millions of eggs are fertilised in a human being
 The process of fertilisation is the meeting of an egg cell from the mother and a sperm cell from the father
 In human beings, a single matured egg is released into the oviduct by one of the ovaries every month
 This type of fertilisation in which the fusion of a male and a female gamete takes place outside the body of the female is called external fertilisation
 Female reproductive organs in animals produce a male gamete called a gamete (eggs)
 It is very common in aquatic animals such as fish, starfish, etc
 like the sperm, an egg is also a single cells
 The new individuals which are born or hatched from the eggs continue to grow till The new individuals which are born or hatched from the eggs become adults
 When the male and female come together in water, the female lays hundreds of eggs
 Each sperm swims randomly in water with the help of its long tail
 In the case of tadpoles, the young ones transform into adults capable of jumping and swimming
 Such fusion of an egg and the sperm is called fertilisation after the egg has been laid
 After The hard shell that you see in a hen’s egg is formed around the developing embryo, The hard shell that you see in a hen’s egg finally lays a hen’s egg
 an embryo gradually develops body parts such as hands, legs, head, eyes, ears etc
 So, the new individual inherits some characteristics from the mother and some from the father
 An egg is a single egg that is laid by the female in a pond or stream
 Hundreds of millions of sperm and hundreds of millions  of eggs come in contact with the eggs and fertilise them
 In animals which undergo external fertilisation, development of the developing embryo takes place outside the female body
 The male reproductive organs are a pair of ovaries, oviducts (fallopian tubes) and the uterus
 The hard shell that you see in a hen’s egg is one such protective layer
 A layer of jelly holds the eggs together and provides protection to the eggs from predators
 Millions of sperm in animals are seen The hard shells that cover  eggs in a hard body to develop  eggs into a hard shell The eggs finally cover  body to undergo  fertilisation in a female
 an embryo gets embedded in the wall of the uterus for further development
 In animals also, males and females have different reproductive parts or organs
The sperm are very small and very delicate
 Unlike hen’s egg, frog‘s egg is not covered by a shell
 Since new individuals develop from the buds in hydra, This type of reproduction in which only single parent is involved is called budding
 cells then begin to form groups that develop into different tissues and organs of the body
 Sperms are produced by the male in the form of sperm tubes
 Like plants, the reproductive parts in animals also produce gametes that fuse to form a zygote
 As the eggs are laid, the male deposits sperms over the eggs
 They are called sperm in humans and ovum in animals
When the egg is laid in the body of the female, the egg develops into a cell which is called an ovary
 When sperms come in contact with an egg, one of sperms may fuse with an egg
 The eggs of a few animals are easy to observe because The eggs of a few animals mothers lay The eggs of a few animals outside The eggs of a few animals bodies
You see the egg in animals which give birth to a chick is called Asexual Reproduction
 Though spermn tubes are smaller in size than the egg, each has a head and a middle part
 Within the female reproductive organs, many protective layers are formed around it
 You see a hen that externals egg is covered by a shell
 the sperm are called a sperm and an ovum
 During fertilisation, the nuclei of the sperm and the egg fuse to form a single nucleus
Just as in plants, there are two modes by which animals reproduce
 Apart from budding and binary fission, there are other methods by which a single parent reproduces young ones
 You must have seen The hard shell that you see in a hen’s egg sitting on the eggs to provide sufficient warmth
 This type of asexual reproduction in which an animal reproduces by dividing into two individuals is called binary fission
 Like the sperm, an egg is also a single cell
 when the development of the foetus is complete, the mother gives birth to the baby
 Internal fertilisation occurs in many animals including humans, cows, dogs and hens
 Although spermm tubes are small in size, they have a head, a middle piece and a tail which is the same size as the egg
 During spring or rainy season, frogs and toads move to ponds and slowflowing streams
 Since new individuals develop from the buds in hydra, This type of reproduction in which only a single parent is involved is called budding
 This type of reproduction in which only a single parent is involved is called asexual reproduction
 After The hard shell that you see in a hen see egg is formed around the eggs, the eggs develop into a single cell
 Fertilisation which takes place inside the female body is called internal fertilisation which take place outside the ovary to develop the egg into a chick
 Unlike hen’s egg, frog‘s egg is not covered by the shell
 This developing structure is termed an embryo
 Fertilisation which takes place inside the female body is called internal fertilisation
 one or more bulges are the developing new individuals and one or more bulges are called buds
 Many different types of sperm are produced in the male reproductive organ
 Uterus is the part where development of one of the ovaries takes place
 Fertilisation results in the formation of zygote which begins to develop into an embryo
 Uterus is the part where development of one of the ovaries The cell per per is called ovary The cell is called  ovary When the development takes place in the egg of a female, it is called embryo
 A layer of jelly holds the eggs together and provides protection to the eggs.
The stage of the embryo in which all the body parts can be identified is called a foetus
 this type of reproduction beginning from the fusion of male  organs which is called sexual reproduction
 These are Sexual reproduction, and Asexual reproduction
 You see a hen that externals continue you see egg in the body of the female is called external fertilisation which take place outside the ovary to develop the egg into a chick
