 A particular type of animal or plant may be endemic to a zone, a state or a country
 Bori and Pachmarhi are two of the most important rock shelters of the country and are located in a part of the Reserve Forest
 In India, there is a total of 55 rock shelters in the country
Wildlife sanctuary, national park, biosphere, reserve forest etc., are protected areas for conservation and preservation of the natural environment of animals and plants
Biosphere reserves help to maintain the biodiversity and culture of the area
A great variety of plants and animals exist on earth
Wildlife Sanctuary are areas where animals are protected from any disturbance to animals and animals habitat
 But, Pachmarhi Biosphere Reserve is unique in the sense that a significant increase in the population of tigers has been seen here
An ecosystem is made of all the plants, animals and microorganisms in an area along with non-living components such as climate, soil, river deltas etc
 The movement of water from the soil surface into the ground is reduced
Some natural causes of deforestation are forest fires and severe droughts
 The objective of Project Tiger was to ensure the survival and maintenance of the tiger population in the country
National Park are areas reserved for wild life where National Park can freely use the habitats and natural resources but hunting and poaching are prohibited there
 Wildlife Sanctuary are areas where animals are protected from any disturbance to animals and animals habitat
Biosphere Reserve are large areas of protected land for conservation of wild life, plant and animal resources and traditional life of the tribals living in the area
 Animals whose numbers are diminishing to a level that whose numbers might face extinction are known as the endangered animals
 Members of a species have common characteristics
 Gradually the fertile land gets converted into deserts
Wildlife Sanctuary, national park, biosphere, reserve forest etc., are protected areas for conservation and preservation of the natural environment of animals and plants
 Physical properties of the soil get affected by plantation and vegetation
Endemic species are those species of plants or animals which are found exclusively in a particular area
Species is a group of population which are capable of interbreeding
Fewer trees would mean that less carbon dioxide will be used up resulting in its increased amount in the atmosphere
 Deforestation is a major cause which leads to the change in soil properties
Some of the threatened wild animals like black buck, white eyed buck, elephant, golden cat, pink headed duck, gharial, marsh crocodile, python, rhinoceros, etc
 Red Data Book is the source book which keeps a record of all the endangered animals and plants
National Park are areas reserved for wild life where National Park can freely use the habitats and natural resources
, are protected and preserved in our wild life sanctuaries
 This means that the species can reproduce fertile offspring only with the members of fertile offspring all species and not with members of other species
 Deforestation means clearing of forests and using that land for other purposes
, are protected areas for conservation of plants and animals present in the area
Project Tiger is one of the many species which are slowly disappearing from our forests
A biosphere reserve may also contain other protected areas in the same region
 Tiger is a species of animals that is found in these species, tiger is seen by the people in these areas
 Biosphere reserves are the areas meant for conservation of biodiversity
Endemic species are those species of plants and animals which are found exclusively in a particular area
This will lead to global warming as carbon dioxide traps the heat rays reflected by earth
 Survival of some animals has become difficult because of disturbances in some animals natural habitat
The increase in temperature on earth disturbs the water cycle and may reduce rainfall
 Rock shelters give us an idea of primitive life of primitive people
 Many of the rock shelters are found in the first Reserve Forest of India
 India also maintains Red Data Book for plants and animals found in India
Biosphere Reserve are large areas of protected land for Conservation of wild life, plant and animal resources and traditional life of the tribals living in the area
Many of the rock shelters are found in the first Reserve Forest of India
Migratory birds fly to far away areas every year during a particular time because of climatic changes
new trees should generally be of the same species which were found in that forest
 Once cutting of trees continues, rainfall and the fertility of the land will decrease
 Species of animals are seen by people and animals in these area is seen as part of our natural environment
 A great variety of plants and animals are essential for the well-being and survival of mankind
 If cutting of trees continues, rainfall and the fertility of the soil will decrease.
Rock shelters also found inside Satpura National Park
 There are more than one hundred National Parks in India
The government lays down rules, methods and policies to protect and conserve the natural resources and policies
 Once upon a time, animals like lions, elephants, wild buffaloes and barasingha were also found in Satpura National Park
 Today, a major threat to survival of these organisms is deforestation
 Moreover, there will be increased chances of natural calamities such as floods and droughths
 Wildlife Sanctuaries like reserve forests provide protection and suitable living conditions to wild animals
 Both of these rock shelters have been identified by the government as Biosphere Reserves
 It is a place where the people are able to live in peace and harmony with nature
 Indian sanctuaries have unique landscapesâ€”broad level forests, mountain forests and bush lands in deltas of big rivers
 Conservation of animals is important for the well-being and survival of mankind
 National parks are areas for the protection and maintenance of natural resources
 This means that the species can reproduce fertile offspring only with the members of fertile offspring own species and not with members of other species
 Nature is an essential part of human life in animals and people
The plants and animals found in a particular area are termed flora and fauna respectively of a particular area
 This means that the members of a species can reproduce fertile offspring only with the members of fertile offspring own species and not with members of other species
 the soil has less humus and is less fertile
 Bird life is seen in these two rock shelters
A great variety of plants and animals are found on earth
 Deforestation also leads to a decrease in the water holding capacity of the soil
To protect our flora and fauna and Fauna habitats, protected areas called wildlife sanctuary, national parks and biosphere reserves have been earmarked
