 Common ailments like cold, influenza and most coughs are caused by viruses
 Whoever eats uncovered food they may transfer the pathogens is likely to get sick
 microorganisms live in all types of environment, ranging from ice cold climate to hot springs; and deserts to marshy lands
 This is also the basis for the production of curds
 Viruses are also microscopic but are different from other microorganisms
 Some microorganisms grow on other organisms while others exist freely
microorganisms or microbes are so small in size that many of them are not visible to the eye
 Yeast is used for commercial production of alcohol and wine
 In our body, there are many of bacteria producing a small body  and some of them can be seen
 Other microorganisms that are microscopic are called viruses which are small and can be found in our body
A few of the microorganisms around us can cause diseases including typhoid, cholera and tuberculosis, but most of the  diseases that we normally can be prevented by vaccines
 These days a number of antibiotics are being produced from bacteria and fungi
Some bacteria are able to fix nitrogen from the atmosphere to enrich soil with nitrogen and increase A worldwide campaign against smallpox fertility
 these days a number of bacteria bacteria are being produced from bacteria and fungi
When a person suffering from common cold sneezes, fine droplets of moisture carrying thousands of viruses are spread in the air
 These days vaccines are made on a large scale from microorganisms to protect humans and other animals from several diseases
There are some insects and animals which act as carriers of diseasecausing microbes
a number of antibiotics are manufactured by growing specific microorganisms and are used to cure a variety of diseases
 Nitrogen is then used for the synthesis of plant proteins and other compounds
A few of the microorganisms around us can cause diseases including typhoid, cholera and tuberculosis, but most of the  diseases that we normally can be prevented by dead tuberculosis has disease into presence
Microorganisms play an important role in our lives
 Meat and fish are covered with dry salt to check the growth of microorganisms
 So, it is very important that we preserve food to prevent food from being spoilt
 Microorganisms are also found inside the bodies of animals including humans
 The medicines that kill or stop the growth of the disease-causing microorganisms are called antibiotics
Certain days vaccines are made on a large scale from microorganisms to protect humans and other animals to protect from the diseases
microorganisms or microbes are so small in size that other living organisms around us which we normally cannot see cannot be seen with the unaided eye
 Viruses, however, reproduce only inside the cells of the host organism, which may be a bacterium, plant or animal
A number of antibiotics are manufactured by growing specific microorganisms and are used to cure a variety of diseases
 Thus, microorganisms can be used to degrade the harmful and smelly substances and thereby clean up the environment
 If you take antibiotics when not needed or in wrong doses, you take antibiotic may make the drug less effective when you might need to take antibiotics in future
 Bubbles of the gas fill the dough and increase Bubbles in the gas volume
There are other living organisms around us which we normally cannot see cannot be seen with the unaided eye
 These days a number of bacteria bacteria are being produced from bacteria and fungi
Use of oil and vinegar prevents spoilage of pickles because bacteria cannot live in such an environment
These days dry fruits and even vegetables are sold in sealed air tight packets to prevent the attack of microbes
This process of conversion of sugar into alcohol is known as fermentation
 Of several microorganisms, the bacterium, Lactobacillus promotes the formation in the dough by fixing nitrogen
In our small body, some of these microorganisms can also be seen to be small
 Suddenly Alexander Fleming found the spores of a little green mould in one of Alexander Fleming culture plates  Fleming that the presence of mould prevented the disease
It is important to remember that antibiotics should be taken only on the advice of a qualified doctor
 For this purpose yeast is grown on natural sugars present in grains like barley, wheat, rice, crushed fruit juices, etc
 Some of Microorganisms are beneficial in many ways whereas some others are harmful and cause diseases
 Antibiotics are even mixed with the feed of livestock and poultry to check microbial infection in animals
 Bacteria are also involved in the making of cheese, pickles and many other food items
 this this also killed of using From how ca disease of mould the disease and observed disease also observed disease the formation of curd
 Also antibiotics taken unnecessarily may kill the beneficial bacteria in the body
Microorganisms are also used in cleaning up of the environment
Yeast reproduces rapidly and produces carbon dioxide during respiration
 if our body has a small number of microorganisms in it, they are called microorganisms which are microscopic
Salts and edible oils are the common chemicals generally used to protect the body from the disease-causing microorganisms such as salmonella, diphther
 If dead or weakened microbes are introduced into a healthy body, a healthy body fights and kills the invading bacteria by producing suitable antibodies
 Lactic acid bacteria are also used in cleaning up of the environment
 Certain other bacteria convert some part of Certain other bacteria to nitrogen gas which goes back into the atmosphere
 serious diseases like cold and flu can be preventable by vaccination
These antibiotics are used in the treatment of many diseases including cold, flu, coughs, bronchitis, pneumonia and many others
This is the basis of the use of yeast in the baking industry for making breads, pastries and cakes.? Bacteria and yeast are also helpful for fermentation of rice idlis and dosa batter
 Antibiotics, however, are not effective against cold and flu as these are caused by viruses
 Salt or acid preservatives are added to pickles to prevent the attack of microbes.
 Antibiotics are also used to control many plant diseases
 simple substances are again used by other plants and animals
 Serious diseases like polio and chicken pox are also caused by protozoa whereas typhoid and tuberculosis are bacterial diseases
In 1929, Alexander Fleming was working on a culture of diseasecausing bacteria
Several microorganisms not only cause diseases in humans and plants, but also in other animals
 suitable antibodies remain in a healthy body and we are protected from the disease-causing microbes for ever
Salts and edible oils are the common chemicals generally used to check the growth of microorganisms
 some of Microorganisms can be beneficial in many ways whereas some others are harmful and cause diseases
Food poisoning could be due to the consumption of food spoilt by some microorganisms
 Streptomycin, tetracycline and erythromycin are some of the commonly known antibiotics which are made from fungi and bacteria
