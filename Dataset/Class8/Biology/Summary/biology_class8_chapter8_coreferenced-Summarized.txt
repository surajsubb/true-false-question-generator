 The entire content of a living cell includes the cytoplasm and the nucleus
 Some cells are long and pointed at both ends
 Each organ is further made up of smaller parts called tissues
 The size of cells in living organisms may be as small as a millionth of a metre (micrometre or micron) or may be as large as a few centimetres
 there is an outer thick layer in cells of plants called cell wall
 For example the nucleus and cell of rat are similar organ tissues, that similar function
 Various other components, or organelles, of cells are present in Cytoplasm
 You will be surprised to know that an organism with billions of cells begins life as a single cell which is the fertilised egg
 The number of cells in living organisms may be less in smaller organisms does not, in any way, affect the functioning of many
 Nucleus is generally spherical and located in the centre of the cell
A white blood cell (WBC) in human blood receives and transfers messages, thereby helping to control and coordinate the working of different parts of the human body
 Different cells in different tissues are also enclosed in cell wall
 Organisms made of more than one cell are called multi-cell (multi : many; cell) organism
 A white blood cell (WBC) in human blood receives and transfers messages, thereby helping to control and coordinate the working of different parts of the body
 Organisms made of more than one cell are called multicellular (multi : many; cellular : cell) organisms
 organisms differ from one another but all are made up of cells
 several small coloured bodies in the cytoplasm of the cells of Tradescantia leaf are scattered in the cytoplasm of the leaf cells
 Paheli realised that an organ is made up of tissues which in turn, are made up of cells
The nucleus of rat is made up from the nucleus  of a rat and the cell of the nucleus is called the nucleus
 partitioned boxes or compartments appeared like a honeycomb
 Today, we know a lot about cell structure and its functions because of improved microscopes having high magnification
Robert Hooke took thin slices of cork and examined them under a microscope
The blood cell is a membrane which separates the blood cell from the blood and the blood from the plasma
a membrane provides shape to the cells of plants and animals
 It is not necessary that the cells in the elephant be much bigger than those in a rat
The egg cell is made of a nucleus and the nucleus of elephant is called nucleus
The number of cells in living organisms may be less in smaller organisms does not, in any way, affect the functioning of many
 The size of the cells has no relation with the size  of the body of the animal or plant
 Blood cell is an important part of human body and the plasma is a part of the organ  of human blood
 Cell wall is an additional covering over a membrane in plant cells
 However, most of  the cells are microscopic in size and are not visible to the unaided eye
 Components of A white blood cell (WBC) in human blood are enclosed in a membrane
 The entire content of a living cell is known as Protoplasm
 Components of a white blood blood cell are enclosed in a membrane
 However, most of Some cells are microscopic in size and are not visible to the unaided eye
 a membrane provides shape to the cells of plants and animals
 Many; cellular (many; cellular ) organisms are of different shapes and sizes
 The number of cells being less in smaller organisms does not, in any way, affect the functioning of many; cellular : cell) organisms
 There are several small coloured bodies in the cytoplasm of the cells of Tradescantia leaf
 But while WBC is a cell,  it is a full fledged organism capable of independent existence
 Cellular structure and function is not necessary that cells in a rat are not necessary to perform the same functions
 A single-celled organism, like amoeba, captures and digests food, respires, excretes, grows and reproduces
 For example, the egg of an ostrich is made from a single egg cell and the egg cell of elephant be made from the same egg cell
 What is the cell in cork?  Cell is a complex living structure unlike other living structures
 an outer thick layer in cells of plants called cell wall is required by plants for protection
 for example, blood cell in human body is an essential part of blood and plasma is part of organ  organ of human
 Protoplasm is called the living substance of the cell
 Similar functions in multicellular organisms are carried out by groups of specialised cells forming different tissues
 many; cellular : cell) organisms are called unicellular organism
 Very little was known about the cell for the next 150 years after Robert hookeâ€™s observations
 the plasma membrane separates cells from one another and also the cell from the surrounding medium
However, some cells are small in size as small as a few millimetre and some are large as large as many millimetres
 Some are branched like the nerve cell or a neuron
 several small coloured bodies in the cytoplasm of the cells of Tradescantia leaf are called plastids
 Millions of living organism organs also vary in shape, size and number of cell
For example, the egg of an ostrich is made from a single egg cell and the egg cell of elephant be made from the same egg cell
 Generally, cells are round, spherical or elongated
 A white blood cell (WBC) in human blood is another example of a single cell which can change A white blood cell (WBC) in human blood shape
 millions of living organisms organs also vary in shape, size and number of cells
 Observe the projections of varying lengths protruding out of ameeba body
 cells in the living organisms are complex living structures unlike non-living bricks
The WBC is a cell,  it is a full fledged organism capable of independent existence
The size of the cells has no relation with the size  of the body of the animal or plant
 The size of the cells has no relation with the size of the body of the animal or plant
 Robert Hooke also noticed that one box was separated from the other by a wall or partition
 several small coloured bodies in the cytoplasm of the cells of Tradescantia leaf are of different colours.
 Each cell in rat is performing the function of a cell in elephant
 cell wall gives shape and rigidity to Some cells
 a membrane called the nuclear membrane is also porous and allows the movement of materials between the cytoplasm and the inside of Nucleus
 Nucleus is an important component of the living cell
