 Levelling The ploughed field is beneficial for sowing as well as for irrigation
The preparation of soil is the first step before growing a crop or sowing
 Despite this diversity, two broad cropping patterns can be identified
 To maintain the moisture of the soil for healthy crop growth, fields have to be watered regularly
 later, people started to cultivate land and produce crops
 Paddy, maize, soyabean, groundnut and cotton are paddy crops and rice, millet and millet are rabi crops
 Tilling before sowing of crops helps in uprooting and killing of weeds, which may then dry up and get mixed with the soil
Before sowing sowing is called ‘turning the soil’ and turning the soil to other is called  ‘levelling�
 fertilisers are used to fertilise the soil in the form of nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, calcium, magnesium, manganese and other substances
 Besides these, pulses and vegetables are grown during summer at many places
 In ancient times, the plough is being used since ancient  times for tilling and tilling is called plough The plough has been used for the tilling or tilling of soil, removing the tilled soil and removing the weeds at the same time
 Plough helps in proper mixing of manure with soil
dead plants and animals get decomposed by soil organisms
 If the harvested grains are to be kept for longer time, the harvested grains should be safe from moisture, insects, rats and microorganisms.
 this is done with the use of iron or wood plough which is made of iron and iron is used for plough This handle which handle is used to remove the weeds and remove the dead plants from the soil, This handle is also used for removing the dead animals from the ground
 If the soil is very dry, the soil may need watering before ploughing
The crops which are sown in the rainy season are called kharif crops
 people were nomadic were wandering in groups from place to place in search of food and shelter
 the soil allows the roots to breathe easily even when the soil go deep into the soil
Since only a few centimetres of the top layer of soil supports plant growth, turning and loosening of soil brings the nutrient-rich soil to the top so that plants can use various nutrients in the dead organisms
Nowadays the seed drill is used for sowing with the help of tractors
 This is done by using a plough
 Accordingly, there is a rich variety of crops grown in different parts of India
the soil helps in the growth of earthworms and microbes present in the soil till the roots of the plants are able to penetrate deep into it
The process of loosening and turning of the soil can be described as ‘ploughing’ or ‘tilling’ in English
Since only a few centimetres of the top layer of soil supports plant growth, turning and loosening of soil brings the nutrient-rich soil to the top so that plants can use various nutrients from dead organisms
 There are many different types of tools used for this purpose
 The climatic conditions like temperature, humidity and rainfall vary from one region to another
 One of the most important tasks in agriculture is to turn the soil with the help of various tools
 the health of farmers should cover the health of farmers nose and mouth with a piece of cloth during spraying of these chemicals
Animals including humans can not make food
 Water is essential because germination of seeds does not take place under dry conditions
 Nutrients dissolved in water are transported to each part of the plant
 It is important to break big clumps of soil called crumbs
 humans receive food from plants, or animals, or both
 Sprinkler system is more useful on the uneven land where sufficient water is not available
In a field many other undesirable plants may grow naturally along with the crop
 Sometimes, manure is added to the soil before tilling
 ploughs are made of wood or iron
The preparation of soil is the first step before growing a crop
 These organisms are friends of the farmer since These organisms further turn and loosen the soil and add humus to it
 levelling of soil  is very important for cultivation of crops
 Weeding is necessary since weeds compete with the crop plants for water, nutrients, space and light
Before sowing, one of the important tasks is to know about the tools used for sowing seeds
 These can be classified on the basis of the season in which These grow
 For example, crop of wheat means that all the plants grown in a field are that of wheat
 The weedicides are diluted with water to the extent required and sprayed in the fields with a sprayer
 Levelling of soil is done with the help of a leveller
 energy from food is utilised by organisms for carrying out organisms various body functions, such as digestion, respiration and excretion
The rainy season in India is generally from June to September
 Therefore, in order to maintain the fertility of the soil, we have to substitute fertilisers with organic manure or leave the field uncultivated in between two crops
 The substances which are used in the field to fertilize the soil are called manure and fertilisers
When plants of the same kind is called a crop
The substances which are added to the soil in the form of nutrients for the healthy growth of plants are called manure and fertilisers
When plants of the same kind are cultivated at one place on a large scale, ‘Agriculture’
 these organisms are friends of the farmer since These organisms further turn and loosen the soil and add humus to it
The water available in wells, lakes and canals is lifted up by different methods in different regions, for taking it to the fields
This is being used since ancient times for tilling the soil, adding fertilisers to the crop, removing the weeds and turning the soil
the soil helps in the growth of earthworms and microbes present in the soil
When sowing the seeds, it is necessary to break soil clumps to get better yield
 crops are of different types like cereals, vegetables and fruits
 various nutrients in the dead organisms are again absorbed by plants
 One of the most important tasks in agriculture is to turn the soil and loosen the soil
Plough is a simple tool which is used for removing weeds and for loosening the soil
Animals including humans can not make Animals including humans own food
 This is made of wood and is drawn by a pair of bulls or other animals
 In this way, various nutrients in the dead organisms are released back into the soil
