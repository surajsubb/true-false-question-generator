There are other living organisms around us which we normally cannot see. other living organisms around us which we normally cannot see are called microorganisms or microbes.microorganisms or microbes are so small in size that other living organisms around us which we normally cannot see cannot be seen with the unaided eye.Microorganisms are classified into four major groups. four major groups are bacteria, fungi, protozoa and some algae. Viruses are also microscopic but are different from other microorganisms. Viruses, however, reproduce only inside the cells of the host organism, which may be a bacterium, plant or animal. Common ailments like cold, influenza and most coughs are caused by viruses. Serious diseases like polio and chicken pox are also caused by viruses. Serious diseases like polio and chicken pox are caused by protozoa whereas typhoid and tuberculosis are bacterial diseases.Microorganisms may be single-celled like bacteria, some algae and protozoa, or multicellular, such as many algae and fungi. Microorganisms live in all types of environment, ranging from ice cold climate to hot springs; and deserts to marshy lands. Microorganisms are also found inside the bodies of animals including humans. Some microorganisms grow on other organisms while others exist freely.Microorganisms play an important role in our lives. Some of Microorganisms are beneficial in many ways whereas some others are harmful and cause diseases. Microorganisms are used for various purposes. Microorganisms are used in the preparation of curd, bread and cake.Microorganisms are also used in cleaning up of the environment. For example, the organic wastes are broken down into harmless and usable substances by bacteria. Bacteria are also used in the preparation of medicines. In agriculture Bacteria are used to increase soil fertility by fixing nitrogen.Curd contains several microorganisms. Of several microorganisms, the bacterium, Lactobacillus promotes the formation of curd. Lactobacillus multiplies in milk and converts Lactobacillus into curd. Bacteria are also involved in the making of cheese, pickles and many other food items.? Bacteria and yeast are also helpful for fermentation of rice idlis and dosa batter.Yeast reproduces rapidly and produces carbon dioxide during respiration. Bubbles of the gas fill the dough and increase Bubbles of the gas volume.This is the basis of the use of yeast in the baking industry for making breads, pastries and cakes.Microorganisms are used for the large scale production of alcohol, wine and acetic acid.Yeast is used for commercial production of alcohol and wine. For this purpose yeast is grown on natural sugars present in grains like barley, wheat, rice, crushed fruit juices, etc.This process of conversion of sugar into alcohol is known as fermentation. The medicines that kill or stop the growth of the disease-causing microorganisms are called antibiotics. These days a number of antibiotics are being produced from bacteria and fungi. Streptomycin, tetracycline and erythromycin are some of the commonly known antibiotics which are made from fungi and bacteria. a number of antibiotics are manufactured by growing specific microorganisms and are used to cure a variety of diseases. Antibiotics are even mixed with the feed of livestock and poultry to check microbial infection in animals. Antibiotics are also used to control many plant diseases.It is important to remember that antibiotics should be taken only on the advice of a qualified doctor. Also you must complete the course prescribed by a qualified doctor. If you take antibiotics when not needed or in wrong doses, you take antibiotics may make the drug less effective when you might need you take antibiotics in future. Also antibiotics taken unnecessarily may kill the beneficial bacteria in the body. Antibiotics, however, are not effective against cold and flu as these are caused by viruses.In 1929, Alexander Fleming was working on a culture of diseasecausing bacteria. Suddenly Alexander Fleming found the spores of a little green mould in one of Alexander Fleming culture plates. Alexander Fleming observed that the presence of mould prevented the growth of bacteria. In fact, the presence of mould prevented the growth of bacteria also killed many of bacteria. From this the mould penicillin was prepared.When a disease-carrying microbe enters our body, our body produces antibodies to fight the invader. our body also remembers how to fight a disease-carrying microbe if our body enters again. If dead or weakened microbes are introduced into a healthy body, a healthy body fights and kills the invading bacteria by producing suitable antibodies. suitable antibodies remain in a healthy body and we are protected from the disease-causing microbes for ever. This is how a vaccine works. Several diseases, including cholera, tuberculosis, smallpox and hepatitis can be prevented by vaccination.A worldwide campaign against smallpox has finally led to A worldwide campaign against smallpox eradication from most parts of the world. These days vaccines are made on a large scale from microorganisms to protect humans and other animals from several diseases.Some bacteria are able to fix nitrogen from the atmosphere to enrich soil with nitrogen and increase A worldwide campaign against smallpox fertility. dead or weakened microbes are commonly called biological nitrogen fixers. Microorganisms decompose dead organic waste of plants and animals converting Microorganisms into simple substances. simple substances are again used by other plants and animals. Thus, microorganisms can be used to degrade the harmful and smelly substances and thereby clean up the environment.Microorganisms are harmful in many ways. Some of Microorganisms cause diseases in human beings, plants and animals. Such disease-causing microorganisms are called pathogens. Some microorganisms spoil food, clothing and leather.Pathogens enter our body through the air our breathe, the water our drink or the food our eat. Pathogens can also get transmitted by direct contact with an infected person or carried by an animal. Microbial diseases that can spread from an infected person to a healthy person through air, water, food or physical contact are called communicable diseases. Examples of such diseases include cholera, common cold, chicken pox and tuberculosis.When a person suffering from common cold sneezes, fine droplets of moisture carrying thousands of viruses are spread in the air. The virus may enter the body of a healthy person while breathing and cause infection.There are some insects and animals which act as carriers of diseasecausing microbes. Housefly is one such carrier. The flies sit on the garbage and animal excreta. Pathogens stick to Pathogens bodies. When The flies sit on uncovered food The flies may transfer Pathogens. Whoever eats uncovered food they may transfer the pathogens is likely to get sick. So, it is advisable to always keep food covered. Avoid consuming uncovered items of food. Another example of a carrier is the female Anopheles mosquito, which carries the parasite of malaria. Female Aedes mosquito acts as carrier of dengue virus.All mosquitoes breed in water. Hence, one should not let water collect anywhere, in coolers, tyres, flower pot, etc. By keeping the surroundings clean and dry we can prevent mosquitoes from breeding.Several microorganisms not only cause diseases in humans and plants, but also in other animals. For example, anthrax is a dangerous human and cattle disease caused by a bacterium. a dangerous human and cattle disease caused by a bacterium is caused by a virus.Several microorganisms cause diseases in plants like wheat, rice, potato, sugarcane, orange, apple and others. diseases in plants like wheat, rice, potato, sugarcane, orange, apple and others reduce the yield of crops.Food poisoning could be due to the consumption of food spoilt by some microorganisms. Microorganisms that grow on our food sometimes produce toxic substances. These make our food poisonous causing serious illness and even death. So, it is very important that we preserve food to prevent food from being spoilt.Bread left unused under moist conditions is attacked by fungus. Microorganisms spoil our food. Spoiled food emits bad smell and has a bad taste and changed colour.Salts and edible oils are the common chemicals generally used to check the growth of microorganisms. Therefore Salts and edible oils are called preservatives. Salt or acid preservatives are added to pickles to prevent the attack of microbes. Sodium benzoate and sodium metabisulphite are common preservatives. Sodium benzoate and sodium metabisulphite are also used in jams and squashes to check Sodium benzoate and sodium metabisulphite spoilage.Common salt has been used to preserve meat and fish for ages. Meat and fish are covered with dry salt to check the growth of microorganisms. Salting is also used to preserve amla, raw mangoes, tamarind, etc.Jams, jellies and squashes are preserved by sugar. Sugar reduces the moisture content which inhibits the growth of bacteria which spoil food.Use of oil and vinegar prevents spoilage of pickles because bacteria cannot live in such an environment. Vegetables, fruits, fish and meat are often preserved by this method.Pasteurised milk can be consumed without boiling as Pasteurised milk is free from harmful microbes. Pasteurised milk is heated to about 700C for 15 to 30 seconds and then suddenly chilled and stored. By doing so, Pasteurised milk prevents the growth of microorganisms. This process of conversion of sugar into alcohol was discovered by Louis Pasteur. This process of conversion of sugar into alcohol is called pasteurisation.These days dry fruits and even vegetables are sold in sealed air tight packets to prevent the attack of microbes.Rhizobium lives in the root nodules of leguminous plants, such as beans and peas, with which Rhizobium has a symbiotic relationship. Sometimes nitrogen gets fixed through the action of lightning. Our atmosphere has 78% nitrogen gas. Nitrogen is one of the essential constituents of all living organisms as part of proteins, chlorophyll, nucleic acids and vitamins. Nitrogen cannot be taken directly by plants and animals. Certain bacteria and blue green algae present in the soil fix nitrogen from the atmosphere and convert Nitrogen into compounds of nitrogen. Once nitrogen is converted into compounds of nitrogen, nitrogen can be utilised by plants from the soil through plants from the soil root system. Nitrogen is then used for the synthesis of plant proteins and other compounds. Animals feeding on plants get these proteins and other nitrogen compounds.When plants and animals die, bacteria and fungi present in the soil convert the nitrogenous wastes into nitrogenous compounds to be used by plants again. Certain other bacteria convert some part of Certain other bacteria to nitrogen gas which goes back into the atmosphere. As a result, the percentage of nitrogen in the atmosphere remains more or less constant.
