 Iron ore was not a resource until people learnt to extract iron from Iron ore
The diversity of life on the earth is conserved
Improving the quality of people’s skills so that they are able to make use of more natural resources is also a human made resource
 The discovery of fire led to the practice of cooking and other processes while the invention of the wheel ultimately resulted in development of newer modes of transport
Therefore  it is the responsibility of the people to make the most use of the resources and use them in a way that is good for the environment and for the people
 Non-recyclable resources is those which have a
 Time and technology are two important factors that can change substances into resources
 The future of our planet and That people is linked with our ability to maintain and preserve the life support system that nature provides
 That is why human beings are a special resource
 The technology to create hydroelectricity has turned energy in fast flowing water into an important resource
 For example a resource may have an economic value if it is used in the right way, but it may not have a value if not used in a right manner
 Sometimes, natural substances become resources only when natural substances original form has been changed.
 Balancing the need to use resources and also conserve they for the future is called sustainable development
 Sometimes, natural substances become resources only when natural substances original form has been changed
 Those that are used with little modification are called natural resources, some are used directly
 Both human and natural resources are used in different ways
 Renewable resources are those which get renewed or replenished quickly
 But both are important and satisfy human needs
 Resources that are drawn from Nature and used without much modification are called natural resources
 Since this period is much more than human life spans, such resources are considered nonewable
 Energy is a resource that can be used in many ways
 Renewable Resources are those with a limited shelf life
 both are related to the needs of the people
 Resources are generally classified into natural, human made and human
 Coal, petroleum and natural gas are some examples
Improving the quality of people’s skills so that they are able to create more resources is known as human resource development
 Other natural resources like the air we breathe, the water in we rivers and lakes, the soils, minerals are all natural resources
 Education and health help in making people a valuable resource
For example, the use of pesticides and herbicides to control the growth of weeds and other pests is a good way to conserve natural resources and to protect the environment
 Using resources carefully and giving they time to get renewed is called resource conservation
 In some cases tools and technology may be needed to use a natural resource in the best possible way
 Yet careless use of certain renewable resources like water, soil and forest can affect land and forest stock
 People can make the best use of nature to create more resources when People have the knowledge, skill and the technology to do so
 Many of natural Resources are free gifts of nature and are used without much modification
Some resources have economic value, some do not
 There are many ways of conserving resources
They are also used to make food, clothing, medicines and other products
The technology to create hydroelectricity has turned energy in fast flowing water into an important resource
 Resource is not the same as a resource or a product
The distribution of natural resources depends upon number of physical factors like terrain, climate and altitude
People use natural resources to make buildings, bridges, roads, machinery and vehicles, which are known as human made resources
 Many of natural resources are free gifts of nature and can be used directly
 People use natural resources to make buildings, bridges, roads, machinery and vehicles, which are known as human made resources
 for example, metals have different value depending on their use
 Technology is the technology that can turn natural substances into
But shortage and drying up of natural water sources is a major problem in many parts of the world today
 Technology is also a human made resource
 Water seems to be an unlimited renewable resource
 Therefore it is our duty to ensure that all uses of renewable resources are sustainable
 People themselves are the most important resource
 Once the stocks are exhausted it may take thousands of years to be renewed or replenished
 Once the stocks are exhausted it may take thousands of years to be renewed or regenerated
 Some of these are unlimited and are not affected by human activities, such as solar and wind energy
 Some of the natural resources that are not renewable are those that have a limited stock of them
 It is the people who make the world a better place
 Each discovery or invention leads to many others
 Non-renewable resources are those which have a limited stock
 Natural resources can be broadly categorised into renewable and non-renewable resources
 But shortage and drying up of natural water sources is a major problem in many parts of the world today
 Since this period is much more than human life spans, such resources are considered non-renewable
 Some resources have economic value, some do not
Utility or usability is what makes an object or substance a resource
 The air we breathe, the water in we rivers and lakes, the soils, minerals are all natural resources
Some of these are unlimited and are not affected by human activities, such as solar and wind energy
It is People themselves ideas, knowledge, inventions and discoveries that lead to the creation of more resources
 It is People themselves ideas, knowledge, inventions and discoveries that lead to the creation of more resources
Time is the time that natural substances are used for their original form
 The distribution of natural resources is unequal because these factors differ so much over the earth
