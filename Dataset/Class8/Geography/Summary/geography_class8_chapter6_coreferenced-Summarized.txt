 The objective of this scheme is to encourage aptitude towards employable skills by giving quality training to probable and existing wage earners
The number of world’ population is measured by the population density of the land surface
 Migrations is the movement of people in and out of an area
 Large number of people are attracted to Industrial areas
Population density is the ratio of the total population available for fifty population to the area of population
This was as there were no proper health facilities to meet the needs of the people and people were not able to produce enough food to meet their requirements
In countries where death rates are decreasing, the pyramid shown for Kenya is broad in the younger age groups, because more infants survive to adulthood
 People always prefer to live on plains rather than mountains and plateaus because these areas are suitable for farming, manufacturing and service activities
 Population density refers to the total area of people living in a unit area of the earth’ s surface
 An interesting way of studying the population composition of a country is by looking at the population pyramid, also called an age-sex pyramid
 Those of the working age are the economically active
 Many more people live north of the equator than south of the Equator
 Human resources like other resources are not equally distributed over the world
 Sixty per cent of the worlds measured the total people of births
 As a result the total increase in population was very low
 Some areas are very crowded and some are sparely populated
 All of people have more than a 100 million people
 There are many countries where the population is growing rapidly
 Most of the rest live in Europe and North America
 In the early 1900s, there were not enough health facilities available for the people to meet  their needs and the world population is very high
 Almost three-quarters of the population lives in two continents Asia and Africa
The way in which people are spread across the earth surface is known as the pattern of population distribution
 Although, the world’s total population is rising rapidly, not all countries are experiencing this growth
 Within countries large number of people may move from the rural to urban areas in search of employment, education and health facilities
The world population has not been stable
 More than 90 per cent lives in the United States
 This just shows how important people are as a resource for the country
Areas of better housing, education and health facilities are more densely populated e
 Nature’s bounty is people with people demands and abilities that turn people into ‘resources’
 This is because although, many children are born, a large percentage of many children die in many children infancy, relatively few become adults and there are very few old people
 the population pyramid also tells us how many dependents there are in a country
 Countries like the United States of America and Australia have gained in-numbers by in-migration or immigration
The shape of the population pyramid tells the story of the people living in a country.
 The size of the top shows the numbers of aged people and reflects the number of deaths
 Osaka in Japan and Mumbai in India are two densely populated areas
The population change refers to change in the number of people during a specific time
 Sufficient food was not available for all the people
 The general trend of international migrations is from the less developed nations to the more developed nations in search of better employment opportunities
 The world population has increased manifold as seen in the Fig 6
The Government of India has a Ministry of Human Resource Development
Places with religion or cultural significance attract people
 Varanasi, Jerusalem and Vatican city are some examples
 Diamond mines of South Africa and discovery of oil in the Middle east lead to settling of people in areas with minerals
  S  years later increase in population was very high, using the birth rate of people per hundred and death rate using the death rate of births per thousand
Areas with mineral deposits are more populated
 It is normally expressed as per square km
 Many more people live north of the Equator than south of the Equator
 Healthy, educated and motivated people develop resources as per their needs
 Why? This is actually due to changes in the number of births and deaths
How crowded a country is, has little to do with a country level of economic development
The main reason for this growth was that with better food supplies and medicine, deaths were reducing, while the number of births still remained fairly high
 The numbers of children are shown at the bottom and reflect the level of births
 Births and deaths are the natural causes of population change
 For an extremely long period of human history, until the 1800s, the world‘s population grew steadily but slowly
 Very few people live in high latitude areas, tropical deserts, high mountains and areas of equatorial forests
 Deaths were very low, use the death rates of births, used the deaths of babies per thousand years later for the increase in world population was low, using death rates were 40 years later
 South Central Asia has the highest density of population followed by East and South East Asia
 Such populations contain a relatively large number of young people and which means a strong and expanding labour force
 As a result of the lack of adequate health facilities, the population of people was very low
This is actually due to changes in the number of births and deaths
The population change refers to change in the numbers of people during a specific time
 Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Vikas Yojna was started in 2015 aiming to train one crore Indian youth from 2016 to 2020
 Fertile plains such as Ganga and Brahmaputra in India, Hwang-He, Chang Jiang in China and the Nile in Egypt are densely populated
: People usually avoid extreme climates that are very hot or very cold like Sahara desert, polar regions of Russia, Canada and Antarctica
 A billion people were born in the world in the 1900s
 Hence, human resource is the ultimate resource
Population density is the number of people living in a unit area of the earth’s surface
The population pyramid of a country in which birth and death rates bothe are high is broad at the base and rapidly narrows towards the top
 Sudan is an example of a country that has experienced a loss in population numbers due to out-migration or emigration
In countries like Japan, low birth rates make the pyramid shown for Kenya narrow at the base
