 Sedimentary rock formations of plains and young fold mountains contain non-etallic minerals like limestone
 Mineral fuels such as coal and petroleum are also found in the sedimentary strata
 Windfarms are the major producers of wind energy in the USA, Germany, Denmark, UK, USA and Spain are noted wind energy production
It is not easy to distinguish between metallic minerals, which contain metals and those that do not contain metals
 Iron ore, gold, silver and oil are also present in commercial quantities
 the continent produces more than half of the world´s tin
 China and India have large iron ore deposits
 Metallurgical minerals like copper, nickel and iron ore are found throughout the world, including the United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa and South Africa
 India also leads in production of lead, antimony and tundsten
 The leading producers of hydel power in the world are Paraguay, Norway, Brazil, and China
 Natural gas is found with petroleum deposits and is released when crude oil is brought to the surface
 The leading coal producers of the world are China, USA, Germany, Russia, South Africa and France
 China and India are among the world‘s leading tin producers
 Remains of plants and animals which were buried under the earth for millions of years got converted by the heat and pressure into fossil fuels
 Natural gas is abundant and is the cleanest hydrocarbon, producing around half the carbon dioxide and just one tenth of the air pollutants of coal when burnt to generate electricity
 Chinese and India are among the world‘s leading tin producers
The mineral deposits in North America are located in three zones: the Canadian region north of the Great Lakes, the Appalachians, the Rocky Mountains and the Rocky foothills of the West
 Moreover, the present rate of consumption continues, the reserves of these fuel will get exhausted use also causes environmental pollution
 Mineable minerals may be fer rous or non-frous
 Thorium is found in large quantities in the Monozite sands of Kerala.
 Metallic minerals contain metal in raw form
 The increasing use of fossil fuels is estimated that if the present rate of consumption continues, the reserves of these fuel will get exhausted
 Minerals can be extracted by mining, drilling or quarrying
Deep wells are bored to take Deep wells out, this is called drilling
 On the basis of composition, minerals are classified mainly as metallic and non-metallic minerals
 South Africa has large deposits of tin, zinc and gold
 Liner ore is also among the top producers of zinc, lead and copper
 Brazil is the largest producer of high grade iron-ore in the world
 Chile and Peru are leading producers of copper
 Liner ore is also among the top producers of zinc, lead and copper.
 Globally, there are several countries which have been in common energy production
Minerals are formed in different types of geological environments, under varying conditions
 Western Cordilleras have vast deposits of copper, lead, zinc, gold and silver
 The geology of Antarctica is sufficiently well known to predict the existence of a variety of mineral deposits, some probably large
 Conventional sources of energy are those which have been in common use for a long time
 A non-ferrous mineral does not contain iron but may contain some other metal such as gold, silver, copper or lead
 Metal-rich minerals such as zinc, chromium, copper is found in Venezuela, lead ese world  Nigeria m  Africa, Zimbabwe, It ium and diamond the world  Argentina is zinc rich
 Mineral oil is found in Venezuela, Argentina, Chile, Peru and Columbia
 This is used as a domestic fuel, in industries such as iron and steel, steam engines and to generate electricity
naturally occurring substance that has a definite chemical composition is a mineral
 your car is found between the layers of earth and is drilled from oil fields located in off-shore and coastal areas
 The process of taking out minerals from rocks buried under the earth’s surface is called mining
 Tidal energy can be harnessed by building dams at narrow openings of the sea
 Most minerals are not evenly distributed over space
 They are concentrated in a particular area or rock formations
 Miners dig out minerals that lie near the surface, by the process known as blasting
 Geothermal energy in the form of hot springs has been used for cooking, heating and bathing for several years
 Metals are hard substances that conduct heat and electricity and have a characteristic lustre or shine
 Ferrous minerals like iron ore, manganese and chromites contain iron
 Minerals that lie at shallow depths are taken out by removing the surface layer; this is known as open-cast mining
 Windfarms are found in Netherlands, Germany, Denmark, UK, USA and Spain are noted for USA and Spain wind energy production
 The coal which we are using today was formed millions of years ago when giant ferns and swamps got buried under the layers of the earth
 Iron ore, nickel, gold, uranium and copper are mined in the Canadian Shield Region, the Appalachian region and the mountain ranges of the west
Recycling of metals is another way in which the mineral resources can be conserved
 Fossil fuel such as coal, petroleum and natural gas are the main sources of conventional energy
 Some minerals are found in areas which are not easily accessible such as the Arctic ocean bed and Antarctica
 The coal producing areas of India are Raniganj, Jharia, Dhanbad and Bokaro in Jharkhand
 Mining is done by removing the surface layer of the rock, this process is known as mining by fire
 Mines are dug out by digging out the layers of rock, which are called mining by water and by drilling by air
 Generally, metallic minerals can be found in igneous and metamorphic rock formations that form large plateaus
 Significant size of deposits of coal in the Transantarctic Mountains and iron near the Prince Charles Mountains of Antarctica is forecasted
 Limestone deposits of Caucasus region of France, mganese deposits of Georgia and Ukraine and phosphate beds of Algeria are some examples
 Deep bores, called shafts, have to be made to reach mineral deposits that lie at great depths
 North America is among the largest producers of tin  ore
 This is then sent to refineries which process the crude oil and produce a variety of products like diesel, petrol, kerosene, wax, plastics and lubricants
 In India, major natural gas reserves are located in the Mumbai High, Krishna Godavari basin, Cambay basin, Tripura and Assam
 Petroleum and natural gas occur far below the earth´s surface
 Titanium rich minerals like tungsten, tin, silver and gold is Zimbabwe, Zimbabwe alt is Zimbabwe
 Natural gas can be used as a domestic and industrial fuel
 Globally, USA, Russia, Iran, Qatar, China, Canada and Australia are the major producers of natural gas
 Asia also has deposits of mica, mica and gypsum
 There are over three thousand different minerals
 Europe is the leading producer of iron-core
