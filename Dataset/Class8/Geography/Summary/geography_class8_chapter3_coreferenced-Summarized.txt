 Human factors such as population and technology are also important determinants of land use pattern
 Water abundance only seems to vary because Water is in constant motion, cycling through the primitive oceans, the air, the land and back again, through the processes of evaporation, precipitation and run-off
 Changes of climate and human interferences can cause the loss of natural habitats for the plants and animals
 In Intercropping, different crops are grown in alternate rows and are sown at different times to protect the soil from rain wash
 Plants provide us with timber, give shelter to animals, produce oxygen we breathe, protects soils so essential for growing crops, act as shelter belts, help in storage of underground water, give us fruits, nuts, latex, turpentine oil, gum, medicinal plants and also the paper that is so essential for your studies
 Other factors are the topography, role of organic material and time taken for the composition of soil formation
 Today the vast changes in the land use patterns also reflect the cultural changes in our society
 Other factors are the topography  and climate  factors
 The ocean water is however saline and not fit for human consumption
 It is the soil that is used to grow crops, overuse of fertilisers or pesticides to make the soil grow crops and fertilizers to make it grow crops
 Some broad mitigation techniques of landslide are as follows: Hazard mapping to locate areas prone to landslide
 Deforestation, soil erosion, constructional activities, forest fires, tsunami and landslides are some of the human and natural factors which accelerate the process of extinction of these resources
  The rugged topography, steep slopes of the mountains, low-lying areas susceptible to water logging, desert areas, thick forested areas are normally sparsely populated or uninhabited
 Water is one of the most abundant natural resources in the world
 Human activities in several parts of the world have disturbed the natural habitats of many species
 Even today, the primitive oceans cover two-thirds of the earth’s surface and support a rich variety of plant and animal life
 Construction of retention wall to stop land from slipping
 There is scarcity of water in many regions of the world
 Landslides are simply defined as the mass movement of rock, debris or the earth down a slope.
 These are the areas that are prone to landslides due to the nature of the parent rock and climatic factors
It consists of organic material, minerals, weathered rock and water
It is also the soil which is used by the people to collect crops to make them grow crops or fertilisers to make crops
 The uneven distribution of population in different parts of the world is mainly due to varied characteristics of land and climate
 All these differ from place to place
It helps the soil to grow the crops and it helps the land to collect the fertilisers
 In the hilly terrain landslides have been a major and widely spread natural disaster that often strike life and property and occupy a position of major concern
 Growing population and their ever growing demand has led to a large scale destruction of forest cover and arable land and has created a fear of losing this natural resource
 Soil erosion and depletion are the major threats to soil as a resource
 Soil is made up of organic matter, minerals and weathered rocks found on the earth
 Hence, such areas can be avoided for building settlements
It also helps the ground to collect rocks to make  it grow plants and fertiliser to make its soil grow  crops and make it fertiliser
 Natural vegetation and wildlife exist only in the narrow zone of contact between the lithosphere, hydrosphere and atmosphere that we call biosphere
It can be classified on the basis of ownership as – private land and community land
 In the coastal and dry regions, rows of trees are planted to check the wind movement to protect soil cover
 Increasing population, rising demands for food and cash crops, increasing urbanisation and rising standards of living are the major factors leading to shortages in supply of fresh water either due to drying up of water sources or water pollution
Land degradation, landslides, soil erosion, desertification are the major threats to the environment because of the expansion of agriculture and construction activities
 This is commonly termed as Land use
Land is among the most important natural resources
 People and These community lands demands are ever growing but the availability of land is limited
The quality of land also differs from place g
 Ground is the material that is available in available for the composition of soil formation
The use of land is determined by physical factors such as topography, soil, climate, minerals and availability of water
 Access to clean and adequate water sources is a major problem facing the world today
The uneven distribution of population in different parts of the world is mainly due to varied characteristics of land and climate
 A prolonged spell of rainfall can cause heavy landslide that can block the flow of river for quite some time
 Afforestation, land reclamation, regulated use of chemical pesticide and fertilisers and checks on overgrazing are some of the common methods used to conserve land resources
 Land degradation, landslides, soil erosion, desertification are the major threats to the environment because of the expansion of agriculture and construction activities
 Humans use huge amounts of water not only for drinking and washing but also in the process of production
 So animals big or small, all are integral to maintaining balance in the ecosystem
 Land is used for different purposes such as agriculture, forestry, mining, building houses, roads and setting up of industries
 Advancement in scientific techniques has empowered us to understand what factors cause landslides and how to manage landslides
 Therefore, the present rate of degradation of land must be checked
 Plains and river valleys offer suitable land for agriculture
 Can you list out the different ways in which Mamba’s and Peter‘s family use land?  What is the difference between Mamba and Peter?  Mamba is the owner of the land and Peter is the land owner of Peter
 Thus, they started encroaching on these community lands to build up commercial areas, housing complexes in the urban areas and to expand Private land in the rural areas
 Trenches are made in front of the barriers to collect water
 Landslides are simply defined as the mass movement of rock, debris or the earth down a slope
 The quality of land also differs from place to place
 Rock is the rock that is made the soil
 The thin layer of grainy substance covering the surface of the earth is closely linked to land
 Increase in the vegetation cover to arrest landslide
 Vulture due to its ability to feed on dead livestock is a scavenger and considered a vital cleanser of the environment
 Insects like bees provide us honey, help in pollination of flowers and have an important role to play as decomposers in the ecosystem
Conservation of creeks, lakes, and wetlands is necessary to save the precious resource from depletion There is a balance in the environment if the relative number of species is not disturbed
