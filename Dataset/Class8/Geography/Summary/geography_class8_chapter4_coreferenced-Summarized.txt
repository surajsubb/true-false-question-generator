 After the soil loses the soil fertility, land is abandoned and the cultivator moves to a new plot
 In favourable climatic conditions as in West Bengal and Bangladesh two to three crops are grown in a year
 Some of the operations involved are ploughing, sowing, irrigation, weeding and harvesting
 Climate with large number of days with sunshine and fertile soils permit growing of more crop annually than one crop annually  on the same plot

In mixed farming the land is used to grow the crops and re-grow the animals
 Brazil is one of the countries where coffee is grown and tea is the major crop of coffee
 The area cultivated and the amount of capital used is large
 The produce may be processed on the farm itself or in nearby factories
 Severe winters restrict the growing season and only a single crop can be grown
 Tertiary activities provide support to the primary and secondary sectors through services
In plantation agriculture the land can be used for the production of crops and the animals are reared to feed the population
 The outputs from a system include crops, wool, dairy and poultry products
 Maize is grown in North America, Brazil, China, Russia, Canada, India, and Mexico

 Two-thirds of India’s population is still dependent on agriculture
 Commercial farming includes commercial grain and mixed farming

Primitive subsistence agriculture includes shifting cultivation and nomadic herding
 A plot of land is cleared by felling the trees and burning the trees
This type of farming is practised to meet the needs of the farmer’s family
 This requires cool climate and well distributed high rainfall throughout the year for the growth of This tender leaves
The land on which the crops are grown is known as arable land
 Agriculture, fishing and gathering are good examples
 Depending upon the geographical conditions, demand of produce, labour and level of technology, farming can be classified into two main types
 Major areas where commercial grain farming is pracised are temperate grasslands of North America, Europe and Asia
 Traditionally, low levels of technology and household labour are used to produce on small output
 Munna Lal is a member of the co-operative society which also advises Munna Lal on the type of fodder for Munna Lal animals, safety measures to protect the health of the livestock and artificial insemination
 Since majority of the farmers do not have lack storage facilities, majority of the farmers are forced to sell his produce even when the market is not favourable to majority of the farmers
 Subsistence farming includes shifting farming, nomadic farming, mixed farming and plantation agriculture
Agriculture or farming can be looked at as a system
The crops grown in commercial grain are used for food and animals
In mixed farming the land is used for growing food and fodder crops and rearing livestock
The ashes are then mixed with the soil and crops like maize, yam, potatoes and cassava are grown
 Severe winters restrict the growing season and only a single crop can be grown  on the same plot
 Wheat and maize are common commercially grown grains
 Crops grown in mixed farming are coffee, sugar cane are single crop of tea, J ane are a type amount of tea c crops
