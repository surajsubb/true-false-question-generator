The processes are also used for the manufacture of other products, such as heavy machinery, building materials and railway coaches
Secondary activities or manufacturing change raw materials into products of more value to people
Industrial regions emerge when a number of industries locate close to each other and share the benefits of each other closeness
 Industries can be classified on the basis of raw materials
Industries may be agro based, mineral based, marine based and forest based depending on the type of raw material Industries use
Secondary activities or manufacturing change raw materials into products
 In case of the textile industry inputs, processes and outputs may be cotton, human labour, factory and transport cost
 Private sector industries are owned and operated by the government, such as Hindustan Aeronautics Limited and Steel Authority of India Limited
 Some of the raw material such as coal is available locally, while the iron ore comes from the iron mines at Minnesota, about 1500 km from Pittsburgh
 Inputs are the raw materials, labour, factory and transport cost
An industrial system consists of inputs, processes and outputs
 Investment of capital is higher and the technology used is superior in large scale industries
 Bhadravati and Vijay Nagar in Karnataka, Vishakhapatnam in Andhra Pradesh, Salem in Tamil Nadu are other important steel centres utilising local resources
Production of automobiles and heavy machinery are large scale industries
 China Central  Information is industry The Central   Japan Central  information is industry  Japan The Information technology The raw materials include steel  ore and other iron industry are China
Size refers to the amount of capital invested, number of people employed and the volume of production
 This is primarily due to the emergence of new textile centres in the country as well as nonupgradation of machines and technology in Ahmedabad textile mills
The information technology for manufacturing inputs, labour material and other inputs include information technology The inputs include the labour material, labour and information technology
Though The finished product is one of the important textile cities in the country, of late, The textile industry developed in Osaka due to several geographical factors has been replaced by other industries, machinery, shipbuilding, automobiles
 iron and steel industry is one of the oldest industries in the world
 Investment of capital is higher and the technology used is superior in large scale companies
 iron and steel industry depend heavily on the iron and steel industry for Almost all sectors of the Indian industry basic infrastructure
 Finished steel is transported to the market by both land and water routes
 The iron and steel and textile industry are the older industries while information technology is an emerging industry
 In case of the textile industry inputs, process and outputs may be cotton, human labour, fabric, yarn, dyeing and printing
 This is used as raw material to manufacture a variety of products
 Small scale industries use lesser amount of equipment and technology as compared to large scale the industries that produce large volumes of products, including automobiles
This is used as raw material to manufacture a variety of products
 Cottage or household industries are a type of small scale industry where the products are manufactured by hand, by the artisans
 Hence, traditional cotton textile industry could not face the competition from the new textile mills of the West, which produced cheap and good quality fabrics through mechanized industrial units
 Major industrial regions of the world are eastern North America, western and central Europe, eastern Europe and eastern Asia
 Basket weaving, pottery and other handicrafts is examples of cottage industry
 After Independence, the government took the initiative and set up several iron and steel plants
 The output obtained is steel which may be used by other industries as raw material
The products produced by these industries are used as inputs for the manufacturing of the products of other industries such as clothing, footwear, footwear and textiles
 The development of the iron and steel industry opened the doors to rapid industrial development in India.
 All the important steel producing centres such as Bhilai, Durgapur, Burnpur, Jamshedpur, Rourkela, Bokaro are situated in a region that spreads over four states — West Bengal, Jharkhand, Odisha and Chhattisgarh
 iron and steel industry was located where raw materials, power supply and running water were easily available
 This is a feeder industry whose products are used as raw material for other industries
 Food processing, vegetable and animal feed industries are examples of agro-based industries
 India has several industrial regions like Mumbai-Pune cluster, Bangalore-Tamil Nadu region, Hugli region, Ahmedabad-Baroda region, Chottanagpur industrial belt, Vishakhapatnam-Guntur belt, Gurgaon-Delhi region and the Kollam-Meerut region
 This place was close to the iron ore, coal and manganese deposits as well as to Kolkata, which provided a large market
 The inputs for Textile industry include raw materials such as iron ore, coal and limestone, along with labour, capital, site and other infrastructure
The industries associated with forests are pulp and paper, pharmaceuticals, furniture and buildings
  The outputs are the end product and the income earned from The outputs
 Forestry based industries and iron industry, the steel industry, Korea is located ile region is located the region is Korea industry is located iron industry
Marine industries are located in the coastal areas of India and other countries in the world
 Marine based industries, USA and textile industry are example of marine based industries
Though The finished product is one of the important textile cities in the country, of late, The textile industry developed in Osaka due to several geographical factors has been replaced by other industries, such as iron and steel, machinery, shipbuilding, automobiles, electrical equipment and cement
 Iron made from iron ore is the product of mineral based industry
The inputs are cotton, cotton textile, fabric and other raw materials and labour for the production of textile and other textile products
 The countries in which iron and steel industry is located are Germany, USA, China, Japan and Russia
 Mineral based industries are primary industries that use mineral ores as Mineral based Industries raw materials as well as the products produced from the mineral based industries raw materials such as iron ore, coal and other minerals
 iron and steel industry has spread to other parts of India
 Forest based industries utilize forest produce as raw resources
It is also used as a raw material for the construction of buildings,
 Special alloys of steel can be made by adding small amounts of other metals such as aluminium, nickel, and copper
 This is used as raw material for the manufacture of a number of other products, such as heavy machinery, building materials and railway coaches
 Based on size, industries can be further classified into small scale and large scale Industries
 Ocean based industries utilise products from the sea and oceans as raw materials to manufacture the products as well
 Almost everything we use is either made of iron or steel or has been made with tools and machinery of these metals
 iron and steel industry can be divided on the basis of raw materials used in 1800 A
 Today, very few of the large steel mills are in Pittsburgh
 Agro based industries use plant and animal based products as their raw materials for production of products such as meat, dairy products, leather, textiles, leather products and food processing
 Industrialisation often leads to development and growth of towns and cities
Before 1947, there was only one iron and steel plant in the country – Tata Iron and Steel Company Limited (TISCO)
 The processes include a wide range of activities that convert the raw material into finished products
 This is because by this time steel works had become very large and iron ore had to be imported from overseas
