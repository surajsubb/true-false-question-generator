 We talk of Disease when We can find a specific and particular cause for discomfort
 However, the word is used in a more limited meaning
 But viruses do not use these pathways at all, and that is the reason why antibiotics do not work against viral infections.
 If we think about this, we realise that this always implies the idea of ‘being well’
 Each of microbes can be classified into different categories will have some essential biochemical life process which is peculiar to that group and not shared with the other groups
 If the number of microbes in the body is very small, the disease manifestations may be minor or unnoticed
 us can be in poor health without there being a simple cause in the form of an identifiable disease
 This would depend a lot on whether the immediate causes are infectious or non-infectious
 But if we get infected with a chronic disease such as tuberculosis of the lungs, then being ill over the years does make us lose weight and feel tired all the time
 We need to be happy in order to be truly healthy, and if We mistreat each other and are afraid of each other, We cannot be happy or healthy
 There is also a social environment that helps us to carry out specific tasks, and to carry the work out and to perform the tasks
The social environment is also necessary for us to be able to do work and to have the opportunity to earn money
 The signs and symptoms of a disease will thus depend on the tissue or organ which the microbe targets
 Disease, in other words, literally means being uncomfortable
For example, if the kidneys are not filtered urine, poisonous substances will accumulate
On the other hand, good health for a musician may mean having enough breathing capacity to play the flute, and good health may mean being able to move the body into difficult but graceful positions
 we have heard the word ‘health’ used quite frequently
 These are examples of social environment which helps the body to move out and perform certain activities
 Many microbial agents can commonly move from an affected person to someone else in a variety of ways
We can think about individual health as well as disease.
 Let us cite an example to try and understand a peculiar property of the immune system that usually fights off microbial infections
 This is why the basic unit of organisms is the social environment, and this is also the basic reason why the body is made up of cells, tissues and organs
 Something or the other is always happening inside Cell
 Cells are made of a variety of chemical substances–proteins, carbo-hydrates, fats or lipids, and so on
 To have the food to be healthy, we need to have enough energy to do the work, and food will have to be earned by doing work
 In addition to these tissue-specific effects of infectious disease, there will be other common effects too
 As we are living in a society, we have to have an opportunity to work and earn money, and for this to be possible, We have to work in the community and in the school
 The ways in which diseases spread, and the ways in which diseases can be treated and prevented at the community level would be different for different diseases
 You can think of many other diseases where the immediate causes will not be infectious
 When there is a disease, either the functioning of one or more systems of the body will change for the worse
 As our noted earlier, if the number of the infecting microbes is controlled, the manifestations of disease will be minor
 We can imagine what the symptoms and signs of an infection will be if we know what the target tissue or organ is, and the functions that are carried out by this tissue or organ
 It is in this context that we will look at the notions of health and disease
 Simply not being diseased is not the same as being healthy
 Thus, many of the effects of HIV-AIDS are because the body can no longer fight off the many minor infections that we face everyday
But if the number of microbes in the body is of the same microbe large, disease can be severe enough to be lifethreatening
But if the number of microbe large, disease can be severe enough to be life threatening
 One would be to reduce the effects of the disease and the other to kill the cause of disease
 Most of other common effects depend on the fact that the body’s immune system is activated in response to infection
 So, for example, health is at risk in a cyclone in many ways
 My grandmother’s health is not good, when we say things like ‘my grandmothers’ or ‘her health is bad’, and we can be in poor health without actually suffering from a particular disease
 But an acute disease, which is over very soon, will not have time to cause major effects on general health, while a chronic disease will do so
 We can now easily see that it is possible to be in poor health without actually suffering from a particular disease
We talk of Disease when We can find a specific and particular cause for discomfort
 For all these interconnected activities, energy and raw material are needed
 The third is that the person suffering from an infectious disease can serve as the source from where the infection may spread to other people
 If we have a common cold, taking antibiotics does not reduce the severity or the duration of disease
 that approach is useful to think of the immediate causes of disease as belonging to two distinct types
 Anything that prevents proper functioning of cells and tissues will lead to a lack of proper activity of the body
  In such places, even Our physical environment is decided by our social environment
 The health of all organisms will depend on all organisms surroundings or all organisms environment
 Food is a necessity for cell and tissue functions
 We can now see that, as a general principle, we can ‘fool’ An active immune system into developing a memory for a particular infection by putting something, that mimics the microbe we want to vaccinate against, into the body
We need to be happy in order to be truly healthy, and if We mistreat each other and are afraid of each other, We cannot be happy or healthy
 ‘Health’ is therefore a state of being well enough to function well physically, mentally and socially
 If someone is suffering from a cold and cough in the class, it is likely that the children sitting around will be exposed to the infection
 As a result, drugs that block one of these life processes in one member of the virus group is likely to be effective against many other members of the virus group
 Complex reactions and repair goes on inside cells
 Obviously, the more crowded We all living conditions are, the more likely it is that such airborne diseases will spread
 Under such conditions, the body will not have the ability to think properly
 Social equality and harmony are therefore necessary for individual health
 Or, if we are not able to control the notes, the notes will not be played correctly
We have seen that cells are the basic units of organisms
 But this kind of symptom-directed treatment by This will not make the infecting microbe go away and disease will not be cured
 My grandmother’s health is not good, when we say things like ‘my grandmothers’ or ‘her health is bad’, and we can be
 In We organs or tissues, there are various specialised activities going on– the heart is beating, the lungs are breathing, the kidney is filtering urine, the brain is thinking
 Being interested in following the teaching in the classroom so that we can understand the world is a ‘healthy attitude’; while not being interested is considered the opposite
 Our live in villages, towns or cities
 This means that many important life processes are similar in the bacteria group but are not shared with the virus group
 On the one hand, we can think of this well-being as effective functioning
