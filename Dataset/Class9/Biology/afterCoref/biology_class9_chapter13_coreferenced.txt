We have seen that cells are the basic units of organisms. Cells are made of a variety of chemical substances–proteins, carbo-hydrates, fats or lipids, and so on. Cell is a dynamic place. Something or the other is always happening inside Cell. Complex reactions and repair goes on inside cells. New cells are being made. In We organs or tissues, there are various specialised activities going on– the heart is beating, the lungs are breathing, the kidney is filtering urine, the brain is thinking. All these activities are interconnected. For example, if the kidneys are not filtering urine, poisonous substances will accumulate. Under such conditions, the brain will not be able to think properly. For all these interconnected activities, energy and raw material are needed. Food is a necessity for cell and tissue functions. Anything that prevents proper functioning of cells and tissues will lead to a lack of proper activity of the body. It is in this context that we will look at the notions of health and disease. we have heard the word ‘health’ used quite frequently. we use the word ‘health’ used quite frequently we as well, when we say things like ‘my grandmother’s health is not good’. Our teachers use the word ‘health’ used quite frequently when Our teachers scold we saying ‘this is not a healthy attitude’. If we think about this, we realise that this always implies the idea of ‘being well’. we can think of this well-being as effective functioning. For we grandmothers, being able to go out to the market or to visit neighbours is ‘being well’, and not being able to do such things is ‘poor health’. Being interested in following the teaching in the classroom so that we can understand the world is a ‘healthy attitude’; while not being interested is considered the opposite. ‘Health’ is therefore a state of being well enough to function well physically, mentally and socially. If health means a state of physical, mental and social well-being, it cannot be something that each one of us can achieve entirely on us own. The health of all organisms will depend on all organisms surroundings or all organisms environment. The environment includes the physical environment. So, for example, health is at risk in a cyclone in many ways. Human beings live in societies. Our social environment, therefore, is an important factor in our individual health. Our live in villages, towns or cities. In such places, even Our physical environment is decided by our social environment. Our need food to be healthy, and food will have to be earned by doing work. For this, the opportunity to do work has to be available. We need to be happy in order to be truly healthy, and if We mistreat each other and are afraid of each other, We cannot be happy or healthy. Social equality and harmony are therefore necessary for individual health. We can think of many other such examples of connections between community issues and individual health. Disease, in other words, literally means being uncomfortable. However, the word is used in a more limited meaning. We talk of Disease when We can find a specific and particular cause for discomfort. This does not mean that We have to know the absolute final cause; We can say that someone is suffering from diarrhoea without knowing exactly what has caused the loose motions. We can now easily see that it is possible to be in poor health without actually suffering from a particular disease. Simply not being diseased is not the same as being healthy. ‘Good health’ for a dancer may mean being able to stretch Good health’ for a dancer body into difficult but graceful positions. On the other hand, good health for a musician may mean having enough breathing capacity in good health for a musician/a musician lungs to control the notes from good health for a musician/a musician flute. To have the opportunity to realise the unique potential in all of us is also necessary for real health. us can be in poor health without there being a simple cause in the form of an identifiable disease. This is the reason why, when us think about health, us think about societies and communities. On the other hand, when us think about disease, us think about individual sufferers. These tissues make up physiological systems or organ systems that carry out body functions. Each of the organ systems has specific organs as the organ systems parts, and the organ systems has particular functions. So, the organ systems has the stomach and intestines, and the organ systems helps to digest food taken in from outside the body. The musculoskeletal system, which is made up of bones and muscles, holds the body parts together and helps the body move. When there is a disease, either the functioning of one or more systems of the body will change for the worse. These changes give rise to symptoms and signs of disease. Symptoms of disease are the things we feel as being ‘wrong’. So we have a headache, we have cough, we have loose motions, we have a wound with pus; these are all symptoms. These indicate that there may be a disease, but These don’t indicate what disease is. For example, a headache may mean just examination stress or, very rarely, a headache may mean meningitis, or any one of a dozen different diseases. Signs of disease are what physicians will look for on the basis of the symptoms. Signs will give a little more definite indication of the presence of a particular disease. Physicians will also get laboratory tests done to pinpoint disease further. The manifestations of disease will be different depending on a number of factors. Some diseases last for only very short periods of time, and Some diseases are called acute diseases. We all know from experience that the common cold lasts only a few days. Other ailments can last for a long time, even as much as a lifetime, and are called chronic diseases. An example is the infection causing elephantiasis, which is very common in some parts of India. Acute and chronic diseases have different effects on our health. Any disease that causes poor functioning of some part of the body will affect our health. This is because all functions of the body are necessary for being healthy. But an acute disease, which is over very soon, will not have time to cause major effects on general health, while a chronic disease will do so. As an example, think about a cough and cold, which all of us have from time to time. Most of us get better and become well within a week or so. And there are no lasting effects on our health. But if we get infected with a chronic disease such as tuberculosis of the lungs, then being ill over the years does make us lose weight and feel tired all the time. us may not go to school for a few days if us have an acute disease. But a chronic disease will make a chronic disease difficult for us to follow what is being taught in school and reduce us ability to learn. In other words, we are likely to have prolonged general poor health if we have an acute disease. Chronic diseases therefore, have very drastic long-term effects on people’s health as compared to acute diseases. As we have seen, it is important to keep public health and community health factors in mind when we think about causes of diseases. We can take that approach a little further. that approach is useful to think of the immediate causes of disease as belonging to two distinct types. One group of causes is the infectious agents, mostly microbes or micro-organisms. Diseases where microbes are the immediate causes are called infectious diseases. This is because the microbes can spread in the community, and the diseases the microbes cause will spread with the microbes. On the other hand, there are also diseases that are not caused by infectious agents. infectious agents causes vary, but infectious agents are not external causes like microbes that can spread in the community. Instead, these are mostly internal, non-infectious causes. For example, some cancers are caused by genetic abnormalities. High blood pressure can be caused by excessive weight and lack of exercise. Similarly, diabetes is not infectious. You can think of many other diseases where the immediate causes will not be infectious. The ways in which diseases spread, and the ways in which diseases can be treated and prevented at the community level would be different for different diseases. This would depend a lot on whether the immediate causes are infectious or non-infectious. Organisms that can cause disease are found in a wide range of such categories of classification. Some of the immediate causes are infectious or non-infectious are viruses, some are bacteria, some are fungi, some are single-celled animals or protozoans. Some diseases are also caused by multicellular organisms, such as worms of different kinds. Common examples of diseases caused by viruses are the common cold, influenza, dengue fever and AIDS. Diseases like typhoid fever, cholera, tuberculosis and anthrax are caused by bacteria. Many common skin infections are caused by different kinds of fungi. Protozoan microbes cause many familiar diseases, such as malaria and kalaazar. All of us have also come across intestinal worm infections, as well as diseases like elephantiasis caused by different species of worms. These categories are important factors in deciding what kind of treatment to use. Members of each one of these groups – viruses, bacteria, and so on – have many biological characteristics in common. All viruses, for example, live inside host cells, whereas bacteria very rarely do. Viruses, bacteria and fungi multiply very quickly, while worms multiply very slowly in comparison. Taxonomically, all bacteria are closely related to each other than to viruses and vice versa. This means that many important life processes are similar in the bacteria group but are not shared with the virus group. As a result, drugs that block one of these life processes in one member of the virus group is likely to be effective against many other members of the virus group. But the same drug will not work against a microbe belonging to a different group. As an example, let us take antibiotics. antibiotics commonly block biochemical pathways important for bacteria. Many bacteria, for example, make a cell-wall to protect Many bacteria. The antibiotic penicillin blocks the bacterial processes that build the cellwall. As a result, Many bacteria become unable to make cell-walls, and die easily. Human cells don’t make a cell-wall anyway, so Penicillin cannot have such an effect on us. Penicillin will have this effect on any bacteria that use such processes for making cell-walls. Similarly, many antibiotics work against many species of bacteria rather than simply working against one. But viruses do not use these pathways at all, and that is the reason why antibiotics do not work against viral infections. If we have a common cold, taking antibiotics does not reduce the severity or the duration of disease. However, if we also get a bacterial infection along with the viral cold, taking antibiotics will help. Even then, we also get a bacterial infection along with the viral cold will work only against the bacterial part of a bacterial infection, not the viral infection. Many microbial agents can commonly move from an affected person to someone else in a variety of ways. In other words, Many microbial agents can be ‘communicated’, and so are also called communicable diseases. Such disease-causing microbes can spread through the air. This occurs through the little droplets thrown out by an infected person who sneezes or coughs (Fig. 13.2). Someone standing close by can breathe in these droplets, and Such disease-causing microbes get a chance to start a new infection. Examples of such diseases spread through the air are the common cold, coronavirus disease (COVID-19), pneumonia and tuberculosis. We all have had the experience of sitting near someone suffering from a cold and catching someone suffering from a cold We all. Obviously, the more crowded We all living conditions are, the more likely it is that such airborne diseases will spread. Diseases can also be spread through water. This occurs if the excreta from someone suffering from an infectious gut disease, such as cholera, get mixed with the drinking water used by people living nearby. The choleracausing microbes will enter a healthy person through the water The choleracausing microbes drink and cause disease in The choleracausing microbes. Such diseases are much more likely to spread in the absence of safe supplies of drinking water. The sexual act is one of the closest physical contact two people can have with each other. Not surprisingly, there are microbial infections such as syphilis or AIDS that are transmitted by sexual contact from one partner to the other. However, such sexually transmitted diseases are not spread by casual physical contact. Casual physical contacts include handshakes or hugs or sports, like wrestling, or by any of the other ways in which we touch each other socially. Other than the sexual contact, the virus causing AIDS (HIV) can also spread through blood-to-blood contact with infected people or from an infected mother to an infected mother baby during pregnancy or through breast feeding. We live in an environment that is full of many other creatures apart from We. It is inevitable that many diseases will be transmitted by other animals. other animals carry the infecting agents from a sick person to another potential host. other animals are thus the intermediaries and are called vectors. The commonest vectors we all know are mosquitoes. In many species of mosquitoes, the females need highly nutritious food in the form of blood in order to be able to lay mature eggs. Mosquitoes feed on many warm-blooded animals, including us. In this way, Mosquitoes can transfer diseases from person to person. The disease-causing microbes enter the body through these different means. Different species of microbes seem to have evolved to home in on different parts of the body. In part, this selection is connected to Different species of microbes point of entry. If Different species of microbes enter from the air via the nose, Different species of microbes are likely to go to the lungs. This is seen in the bacteria causing tuberculosis. If Different species of microbes enter through the mouth, Different species of microbes can stay in the gut lining like the bacteria causing tuberculosis. Or Different species of microbes can go to the liver, like the viruses that cause jaundice. But this needn’t always be the case. An infection like HIV, that comes into the body via the sexual organs, will spread to lymph nodes all over the body. Malaria-causing microbes, entering through a mosquito bite, will go to the liver, and then to the red blood cells. The virus causing Japanese encephalitis, or brain fever, will similarly enter through a mosquito bite. But a mosquito bite goes on to infect the brain. The signs and symptoms of a disease will thus depend on the tissue or organ which the microbe targets. If the lungs are the targets, then symptoms will be cough and breathlessness. If the liver is targeted, there will be jaundice. If the brain is the target, we will observe headaches, vomiting, fits or unconsciousness. We can imagine what the symptoms and signs of an infection will be if we know what the target tissue or organ is, and the functions that are carried out by this tissue or organ. In addition to these tissue-specific effects of infectious disease, there will be other common effects too. Most of other common effects depend on the fact that the body’s immune system is activated in response to infection. An active immune system recruits many cells to the affected tissue to kill off The disease-causing microbes. This recruitment process is called inflammation. As a part of This recruitment process, there are local effects such as swelling and pain, and general effects such as fever. In some cases, the tissue-specificity of the infection leads to very general-seeming effects. For example, in HIV infection, HIV infection goes to An active immune system and damages HIV infection function. Thus, many of the effects of HIV-AIDS are because the body can no longer fight off the many minor infections that we face everyday. Instead, every small cold can become pneumonia. Similarly, a minor gut infection can produce major diarrhoea with blood loss. Ultimately, it is these other infections that kill people suffering from HIV-AIDS. It is also important to remember that the severity of disease manifestations depend on the number of microbes in the body. If the number of microbes in the body is very small, the disease manifestations may be minor or unnoticed. But if the number of microbes in the body is of the same microbe large, disease can be severe enough to be lifethreatening. An active immune system is a major factor that determines the number of microbes surviving in the body. There are two ways to treat an infectious disease. One would be to reduce the effects of the disease and the other to kill the cause of disease. For the first, we can provide treatment that will reduce the symptoms. the symptoms are usually because of inflammation. For example, we can take medicines that bring down fever, reduce pain or loose motions. We can take bed rest so that We can conserve We energy. This will enable We to have more of This available to focus on healing. But this kind of symptom-directed treatment by This will not make the infecting microbe go away and disease will not be cured. For that, We need to be able to kill off The disease-causing microbes. One way is to use medicines that kill microbes. We have seen earlier that microbes can be classified into different categories. microbes can be classified into different categories are viruses, bacteria, fungi or protozoa. Each of microbes can be classified into different categories will have some essential biochemical life process which is peculiar to that group and not shared with the other groups. These processes may be pathways for the synthesis of new substances or respiration. pathways for the synthesis of new substances or respiration will not be used by us either. For example, our cells may make new substances by a mechanism different from that used by bacteria. We have to find a drug that blocks the bacterial synthesis pathway without affecting We own. This is what is achieved by the antibiotics that We are all familiar with. Similarly, there are drugs that kill protozoa such as the malarial parasite. One reason why making anti-viral medicines is harder than making antibacterial medicines is that viruses have few biochemical mechanisms of viruses own. viruses enter our cells and use our machinery for viruses life processes. This means that there are relatively few virus-specific targets to aim at. Despite this limitation, there are now effective anti-viral drugs, for example, the drugs that keep HIV infection under control. There are three limitations of this approach to dealing with infectious disease. The first is that once someone has a disease, their body functions are damaged and may never recover completely. The second is that treatment will take time, which means that someone suffering from a disease is likely to be bedridden for some time even if we can give proper treatment. The third is that the person suffering from an infectious disease can serve as the source from where the infection may spread to other people. This leads to the multiplication of the above difficulties. It is because of such reasons that prevention of diseases is better than diseases cure. If we look at the means of diseases spreading, we can get some easy answers. For airborne microbes and those carried by droplets, we can prevent exposure by providing living conditions that are not overcrowded, maintaining appropriate physical distance, wearing appropriate masks, practising hand hygiene, etc. For water-borne microbes, we can prevent exposure by providing safe drinking water. This can be done by treating safe drinking water to kill any microbial contamination. For vector-borne infections, we can provide clean environments. This would not, for example, allow mosquito breeding. In other words, public hygiene is one basic key to the prevention of infectious diseases. In addition to these issues that relate to the environment, there are some other general principles to prevent infectious diseases. To appreciate some other general principles to prevent infectious diseases, let us ask a question us have not looked at so far. Normally, us are faced with infections everyday. If someone is suffering from a cold and cough in the class, it is likely that the children sitting around will be exposed to the infection. But all of the children sitting around do not actually suffer from disease. An active immune system is normally fighting off microbes. our have cells that specialise in killing infecting microbes. cells that specialise in killing infecting microbes go into action each time infecting microbes enter the body. If cells that specialise in killing infecting microbes are successful, our do not actually come down with any disease. cells that specialise in killing infecting microbes manage to kill off the infection long before the infection assumes major proportions. As our noted earlier, if the number of the infecting microbes is controlled, the manifestations of disease will be minor. In other words, becoming exposed to or infected with an infectious microbe does not necessarily mean developing noticeable disease. So, one way of looking at severe infectious diseases is that severe infectious diseases represents a lack of success of An active immune system. The functioning of An active immune system, like any other system in our body, will not be good if proper and sufficient nourishment and food is not available. Therefore, the second basic principle of prevention of infectious disease is the availability of proper and sufficient food for everyone. The specific ways of preventing infections relate to a peculiar property of the immune system that usually fights off microbial infections. Let us cite an example to try and understand a peculiar property of the immune system that usually fights off microbial infections. These days, there is no smallpox anywhere in the world. But as recently as a hundred years ago, smallpox epidemics were not at all uncommon. In such an epidemic, people used to be very afraid of coming near someone suffering from disease since people were afraid of catching disease. However, there was one group of people who did not have this fear. one group of people who did not have this fear would provide nursing care for the victims of smallpox. This was a group of people who had had smallpox earlier and survived This, although with a lot of scarring. In other words, if you had smallpox once, there was no chance of suffering from smallpox again. So, having disease once was a means of preventing subsequent attacks of infectious disease. This happens because when An active immune system first sees an infectious microbe, An active immune system responds against An active immune system and then remembers An active immune system specifically. So the next time that particular microbe, or An active immune system close relatives enter the body, An active immune system responds with even greater vigour. This eliminates the infection even more quickly than the first time around. This is the basis of the principle of immunisation. We can now see that, as a general principle, we can ‘fool’ An active immune system into developing a memory for a particular infection by putting something, that mimics the microbe we want to vaccinate against, into the body. This does not actually cause disease but This would prevent any subsequent exposure to the infecting microbe from turning into actual disease. Many such vaccines are now available for preventing a whole range of infectious diseases, and provide a disease-specific means of prevention. There are vaccines against tetanus, diphtheria, whooping cough, measles, polio and many others. vaccines against tetanus, diphtheria, whooping cough, measles, polio and many others form the public health programme of childhood immunisation for preventing infectious diseases. Of course, such a programme can be useful only if such health measures are available to all children. Some hepatitis viruses, which cause jaundice, are transmitted through water. There is a vaccine for one of Some hepatitis viruses, which cause jaundice, hepatitis A, in the market. But the majority of children in many parts of India are already immune to hepatitis A by the time hepatitis A are five years old. This is because hepatitis A are exposed to HIV infection through water.
