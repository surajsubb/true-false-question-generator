 Furthermore, organisms would need to have a single body design to function properly
This would have an effect on every aspect of cell design
 However, us do not have more than a tiny fraction of this time to try and understand all these living organisms, so us cannot look at all these live organisms one by one
 The body design of an organism is the most fundamental characteristic of the living things body design in form and function
 This is a very simple way of looking at life, but misleading too
 Aristotle also classified plants according to the ability of the plant to produce its own food or to acquire it from the external environment
 So, once a certain body design comes into existence, a certain body design will shape the effects of all other subsequent design changes, simply because a certain body design already exists
Being able to produce oneâ€™s own food versus having to get food from outside would make very different body designs
 Therefore, organisms which do not have a clearly demarcated nucleus and other organelles would need to have other organelles biochemical pathways organised in very different ways
 Some characteristics are likely to make more wide-ranging changes in body design than others
Attempts at classifying living things into groups have been made since time immemorial
 This means that the classification of life forms will be closely related to life forms evolution
 Instead, we look for similarities among the organisms, which will allow we to put all these different living organisms into different classes and then study different classes or groups as a whole
 In such a body design, Cells that group together to form a single organism would not be identical
 He also classified animals based on whether they lived on the land or in water
Most life forms that are see today have arisen by an accumulation of changes in body design that allow the organism possessing them to survive better
 Instead, we look for similarities among the organisms, which will allow we to put all these living organisms into different classes and then study different classes or groups as a whole
Cells that group together to form a single organism use the principle of division of labour
 Greek thinker Aristotle classified animals according to whether animals lived on land, in water or in the air
 As a result, an Amoeba and a worm are very different, based on the need to make the basic designs own food (plant) and to acquire the food (animal)
 Within the main broad groups of organisms, smaller subgroups will be decided by less important characteristics
The characteristics of body design used for classification of plants will be very different from those important for classifying animals
 Further, nucleated cells would have the capacity to participate in making a multicellular organism because nucleated cells can take up specialised functions
Therefore, nucleus can be a basic characteristic of classification
 This makes a very basic distinction in the body designs of organisms
 Such differences would be important in the classification and classification of organisms too
 Therefore a single cell design would be essential
 That would create a single life form
 However this is a very simple way of looking at life, but misleading too
This bewildering variety of life around us has evolved on the earth over millions of years
This bewildering variety of life ants do all living categor on the earth over millions of years
 Some characteristics are likely to be more basic than others
 Rather, groups of cells will carry out different functions
 This would create the main broad groups of organisms
 This is because the basic designs are different, based on the need to make the basic designs own food (plants), or acquire it (animals)
All living things are identified and categorised on the basis of the basic characteristics of the body design, which is the ability to produce food (plants), or acquire it (animals)
 There is a role of time in this as well
All living things are identified and categorised on the basis of All living things body design in form and function
 However, us do not have more than a tiny fraction of this time to try and understand all these living organisms, so us cannot look at all these living organisms one by one
 Therefore, nucleus can be a basic characteristic of classification
 The basic designs of animals and plants are very similar, but the basic design features of plants and animals are not the same, because they are different in their ability to either produce their own food from the environment, or to obtain it from outside (plant)
 So, once a certain body design comes into existence, a certain other body design will shape the effects of all other subsequent design changes, simply because a different body design already exists
 For example, organisms which do have a clearly demarcated nucleus would not be identical
 Therefore, these design features (having a skeleton, for example) are to be used to make sub-groups, rather than making broad groups
 Further, nucleated cells would have the capacity to participate in the process of making a multicellular organism, because nucleated cell can take up specialised functions
 As a result, an Amoeba and a worm are very different in an Amoeba and a worm body design
 But there are more fundamental differences among organisms
All organisms also have different cell types
 A eukaryotic cell has membrane-bound organelles, including a nucleus, which allow cellular processes to be carried out efficiently in isolation from each other
This makes a very basic distinction in the cell designs
Most organisms have different biochemical pathways organised in very different ways
 Thus, there would be differences in cell types and functions
 This would have an effect on every aspect of cell design
 In order to make relevant groups to study the variety of life forms, we need to decide which characteristics decide more fundamental differences among organisms
 In other words, characteristics that came into existence earlier are often more important than characteristics that have come into existence later
 It is also the most basic characteristic in the body designs of organisms
 In other words, characteristics that came into existence earlier are likely to be more basic than characteristics that have come into existence later
 Instead, groups of cells will carry out specialised functions.
