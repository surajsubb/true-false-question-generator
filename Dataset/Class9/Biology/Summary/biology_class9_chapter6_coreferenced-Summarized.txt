 Since cells carry out only a particular function, cells do it very efficiently
So, there is no such demarcation of dividing and nondividing regions in animals
 Animals on the other hand move around in search of food, mates and shelter
In unicellular organisms, a single cell performs all basic functions
In plants, vascular tissues conduct food and water from one part of the plant to other parts
 There are some tissues in plants that divide throughout some tissues in plants that divide throughout their life life
 Each specialised function is taken up by a different group of cells
 so, multi tissue is found found in animals as well
 Apical meristem is present at the growing tips of stems and roots and increases the length of the stem and the root
 relatively unspecialised cells with thin cell walls are usually loosely arranged in spaces in the plant
Some plants have meristemic tissue and some have meristeem, some have nonmer
 A few layers of cells beneath the epidermis are generally simple persistent tissue
 Based on the dividing capacity of some tissues and the number of cells that are present in each tissue, various plant tissues can be classified as simple permanent with thin cells, simple permanent without cell walls, simple non-permanent with thick cell walls and simple nonpermanent, non-meristem, meristeme, meristeem, nonmeristeem and nonmeristeme
 Cell growth in animals is more uniform
 The growth in plants is limited to certain regions, while this is not so in animals
 Based on the dividing capacity of some tissues and the number of cells that are present in each tissue, various plant tissues can be classified as simple permanent with thin cells, simple permanent without cell walls, simple non-permanent with thick cell walls and simple nonpermanent
 This fundamental difference reflects the different modes of life pursued by these two major groups of organisms, particularly in these two major groups of organisms different feeding methods
 since Plants have to be upright, Plants have a large quantity of supportive tissue
 Some tissues are non-living cells, some are growing cells and some are meristeems
 Animals on the other hand move around in search of food, mates and shelter consume more energy as compared to plants
 Another difference between animals and plants is in the pattern of growth
 So, there is no such demarcation of dividing and nondividing regions in animals
 A few layers of cells beneath the epidermis are generally simple permanent tissue
Cells of meristematic tissue have dense cytoplasm, thin cellulose walls and prominent nuclei
There are some tissues in plants that divide throughout their life life, while there are other tissues in animals that do not divide
 most of cells are specialised to carry out specific functions
Each specialised function is taken up by a different group of cells
 Cells specialising in one function are often grouped together in the body
 For example, in Amoeba, a single cell carries out movement, intake of food, gaseous exchange and excretion.
All cells are similar in structure and/or work together to achieve a different function forms a tissue
The growth in plants is limited to certain regions, while this is not so in animals,
 There are other plants that have merismatic tissue
 Parenchyma is the most common simple permanent tissue
 This cluster of cells, called a tissue, is arranged and designed so as to give the highest possible efficiency of function
 A group of cells that are similar in structure and/or work together to achieve a particular function forms a tissue
 Also, these two major groups of organisms are differently adapted for a sedentary existence on one hand (plants) and active locomotion on the other (animals), contributing to this difference in organ system design
 some tissues in plants that divide throughout their life are localised in certain regions
 based on the number and shape of cells in plants, some plants have simple permanent cells, while some have simple nonliving cells and simple permanent
 Most of the tissues Animals on the other hand move around in search of food, mates and shelter consume more energy as compared to plants
Some plants have meristemic tissue and some have meristeemi
 The structural organisation of organs and organ systems is far more specialised and localised in complex animals than even in very complex plants
 there are some tissue in plants and animals that are living and some that are nonliving
 Apical merismem is present at the growing tips of stems and roots and increases the length of the stem and the root
 Most of cells are specialised to carry out specific functions
Differentiating between cells are relatively large in size
 Blood, phloem and muscle are all examples of tissues
 this fundamental difference reflects the different modes of life pursued by these two major groups of organisms, particularly
 for example, some animals in plants do not have any tissues in their life
 Intercalary merism seen in some plants is located near the node
 Since Plants have to be upright, Plants have a large quantity of supportive tissue
 Most of the tissues Animals on the other hand move around in search of food, mates and shelter contain are living
 New cells produced by meristem are initially like those of meristem itself, but as those of meristem itself grow and mature, those of meristem itself characteristics slowly change and those of meristem itself become differentiated as components of other tissues
 For example, in Amoeba, there are hundreds of millions of living cells in the cell
Based on the dividing capacity of some tissues in plants that divide throughout their life, various plant tissues can be classified as growing or meristematic tissue and permanent tissue
 the girth of a stem or root increases due to lateral merism (cambium)
The structure and design of organ systems in animals are more complex than the structure of organ system in plants
 In human beings, muscle cells contract and relax to cause movement, nerve cells carry messages, blood flows to transport oxygen, food, hormones and waste material and so on
 In plants, vascular tissues conduct food and water from one part of the plant to other parts
Differentiation leads to the development of various types of permanent tissues
 relatively unspecialised cells with thin cell walls are usually loosely arranged, thus large spaces between cells are found in simple permanent tissue
In animals, the organ system is more complex and design even structural  sedem system ( meristeme, meristeem, nonmeristeem andnonmeristeme
 So, multi-cellular organisms show division of labour
 This means that a particular function is carried out by a cluster of cells at a definite place in the body
