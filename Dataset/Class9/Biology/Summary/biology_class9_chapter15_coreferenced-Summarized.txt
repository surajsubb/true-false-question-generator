 As Catlas are surface feeders, Rohus feed in the middle-zone of the pond, Mrigals and Common Carps are bottom feeders, and Grass Carps feed on the weeds, together local and imported fish species can use all the food in the pond without competing with each other
 Cereals such as wheat, rice, maize, millets and sorghum provide us carbohydrate for energy requirement
 And oil seeds including soyabean, ground nut, sesame, castor, mustard, linseed and sunflower provide us with necessary fats
 Fish culture is sometimes done in combination with a rice crop, so that fish are grown in the water in the paddy field
 Scientific management practices should be undertaken to obtain high yields in the fields, for example, the use of fertilizers, pesticides, herbicides, insecticides, and insecticides to control the pests and
 While capture fishing is also done in such inland water bodies, the yield is not high
 If we think of the practices involved in farming, we can see that we can divide it into three stages
 Growth of plants and flowering are dependent on sunlight
 For new varieties of crops be accepted, it is necessary that the variety produces high yields from farms
 Dwarfness is desired in cereals, so that less nutrients are consumed by these crops
 The availability of moisture and irrigation facilities decide the choice of the crop to be cultivated after one harvest
 Preventive and control measures include strict cleaning of the produce before storage, proper drying of the produce first in sunlight and then in shade, and fumigation using chemicals that can kill pests
 Also, as we have seen in the previous chapter, continuous use of fertilizers in an area can destroy soil fertility because the organic matter in the soil is not replenished and micro-organisms in the soil are harmed by the fertilizers used
 Animal feed includes: (a) roughage, which is largely fibre, and (b) concentrates, which are low in fibre and contain relatively high levels of proteins and other nutrients
 One problem with such composite fish culture is that many of these fish breed only during monsoon
 In addition to these food crops, fodder crops like berseem, oats or sudan grass are raised as food for the livestock
 As a result, there are more chances of causing damage to our natural resources to the point of destroying their balance completely
 Therefore, we do not have any major scope for increasing the area of land under cultivation
 In addition to honey, the beehives are a source of wax which is used in various medicinal preparations
We know that all living organisms in the world need food
 Vegetables, spices and fruits provide a range of vitamins and calories, in addition to small amounts of protein, carbohydrates and fats
 Also, simply increasing grain production for storage in warehouses cannot solve the problem of malnutrition and hunger
 Our population is more than one billion people, and Its population is still growing
 Scientific management practices should be undertaken to obtain high yields from farms
 The majority of our population depends on agriculture for  its survival, and agriculture is also the major source of livelihood
 Photoperiod is related to the duration of sunlight
 The cross-breeding programmes between Indian (indigenous, for example, Aseel) and foreign (exotic, for example, Leghorn) breeds for variety improvement are focused on to develop new varieties for the following desirable traits - number and quality of chicks, dwarf broiler parent for commercial chick production, summer adaptation capacity, low maintenance requirements, reduction in the size of the egg-laying bird with ability to utilise more fibrous cheaper diets formulated using agricultural by-products
  The first is the choice of seeds for planting
 To overcome a major problem in fish farming, ways have now been worked out to breed these fish in ponds using hormonal stimulation
 Both plants and animals are major sources of food for us
 and with a maximum input of organic manures, recycled farm-wastes (straw and livestock excreta), use of bio-agents such as culture of blue green algae in preparation of biofertilizers, neem leaves or turmeric specifically in grain storage as bio-pesticides, with healthy cropping systems
 Cultivation practices and crop yield are related to weather, soil quality and availability of water
 As the population increases and as living standards increase, the demand for milk, eggs and meat is also going up
 Most agriculture in India is rain-fed, that is, the success of crops in most areas is dependent on timely monsoons and sufficient rainfall spread through most of the growing season
We know that all living organisms need food
 For sustained livelihood, one should undertake mixed farming, intercropping, and integrated farming practices, for example, combine agriculture with livestock/poultry/fisheries/ bee-keeping
 Under such conditions, several different kinds of irrigation systems are adopted to supply water to agricultural lands depending on the kinds of water resources available
 The water source of the fish can be either seawater or fresh water, such as in rivers and ponds
 Different crops require different climatic conditions, temperature and photoperiods for Different crops growth and completion of Different crops life cycle
 We have had the green revolution, which contributed to increased food-grain production
 The food requirements of dairy animals are of two types: (a) maintenance requirement, which is the food required to support the animal to live a healthy life, and (b) milk producing requirement, which is the type of food required during the lactation period
This ensures maximum utilisation of the nutrients supplied, and also prevents pests and diseases from spreading to all the plants belonging to one crop in a field
 In short, it is the money or financial conditions that allow farmers to take up different farming practices and agricultural technologies.
 Food supplies proteins, carbohydrates, fats, vitamins and minerals, all of which we require for body development, growth and health
 If weeds and pests are not controlled at the appropriate time then weeds and pests can damage Field crops so much that most of the crop is lost
 This can be done by farming on more land
 There are some crops, which are grown in rainy season, called the kharif season from the month of June to October, and some of the crops are grown during the dry season, which is called the rabi season from November to April
Therefore, it is important that we should increase food production without degrading our environment and disturbing the balances maintaining it
The major groups of activities and activities of agriculture and livestock are agriculture, livestock husbandry and agriculture
 Efforts to meet the food demand by increasing food production have led to some successes so far
 For new varieties of crops to be accepted, it is necessary that the variety produces high yields under different conditions that are found in different areas
 Farmers would need to be provided with good quality seeds of a particular variety, that is, the seeds should all be of the same variety and germinate under the same conditions
For example, in India there is a four times increase in the production of food grains from 1952 to 2010 with only 25% increase in a year, and only 10% increase of the cultivable land area
 Therefore, it is necessary to increase our production efficiency for both crops and livestock
 It is important to increase our production efficiency for both crops and livestock
 Varieties or strains of crops can be selected by breeding for various useful characteristics such as disease resistance, response to fertilisers, product quality and high yields
 Increasing the incomes of people working in agriculture is therefore necessary to combat the government’s policy of food security
 We have also had the white revolution, which has led to better and more efficient use as well as availability of milk
 As marine fish stocks get further depleted, the demand for more fish can only be met by such culture fisheries, a practice called mariculture
 Factors responsible for such losses are biotic— insects, rodents, fungi, mites and bacteria, and abiotic— inappropriate moisture and temperatures in the place of storage
 Pulses like gram (chana), pea (matar), black gram (urad), green gram (moong), chickpea (sambar), millet (kharif), cotton (bajra), cottonseed (bijli), cotton seed (budra), corn seed (kumkum), soybean (baklava), corn (kurma), soybeans (kamal), millets (mukha) and sunflowers (sugarcane) are the major food crops for the human body
 us obtain most of this food from agriculture and animal husbandry
 However, these revolutions mean that We natural resources are getting used more intensively
