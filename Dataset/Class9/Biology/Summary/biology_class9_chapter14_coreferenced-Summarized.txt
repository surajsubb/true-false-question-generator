 And this forms the broad outline of the oxygen-cycle in nature Though we usually think of oxygen as being necessary to life in the process of respiration, it might be of interest to you to learn that some forms of life, especially bacteria, are poisoned by elemental oxygen
 As the air rises, a region of low pressure is created and air over the sea moves into this area of high pressure
 Other than these bacteria, the only other manner in which the nitrogen molecule is converted to nitrates and nitrites is by a physical process
 It is interesting to note that even the composition of air is the result of life on Earth
 In planets such as Venus and Mars, where no life is known to exist, the major component of the atmosphere is found to be carbon dioxide
In planets such as Venus and Mars, where no life is known to exist, the major component of the atmosphere is found to be carbon dioxide
 On being heated, convection currents are set up in the air
 This life-supporting zone of Earth where the atmosphere, the hydrosphere and the lithosphere interact and make life possible, is known as the biosphere
 Substances are also transported from one part of our body to the other in a dissolved form
 Presence of high levels of all these pollutants cause visibility to be lowered, especially in cold weather when water also condenses out of air
 Aquatic organisms are used to a certain range of temperature in the water-body where Aquatic organisms live, and a sudden marked change in this temperature would be dangerous for Aquatic organisms or affect Aquatic organisms breeding
 all the movements of air resulting in diverse atmospheric phenomena are caused by the uneven heating of the upper atmosphere and the uneven cooling of the lower atmosphere
 The air that covers the whole of Earth like a blanket, is called the atmosphere
 Since all parts of the rock do not expand and contract at the same rate, this results in the formation of cracks and ultimately the huge rocks break up into smaller pieces
 We know that air is a bad conductor of heat
 the air can be heated from below by the radiation that is reflected back or re-radiated by the land or water bodies
 Think of the moon, which is about the same distance from the Sun that the Earth is
 In fact, even the process of nitrogen-fixing by bacteria does not take place in the presence of oxygen
 In fact, the percentage of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is said to have doubled since the industrial revolution when human beings started burning fossil fuels on a very large scale.
 During the day, the direction of the wind would be from the sea to the land
 The atmosphere can be heated from below by the radiation that is reflected back or re-radiated by the land or water bodies
 The nutrient content of a soil, the amount of humus present in The mineral nutrients that are found in a particular soil and the depth of the soil are some of the factors that decide which plants will thrive on that soil
 Another process which results in the consumption of oxygen and the concomitant production of Carbon dioxide is combustion
 Sometimes in these fires, the temperature of air form these air condplets expands in water, sleplets of water, condplets of snow and other drops the air form the air condensation in water form these droplets of hail or precipitation in water is formed
  This includes not just human activities, which burn fuels to get energy, but also forest fires
 Use of these substances over long periods of time also kills the Earthworms which are instrumental in making the rich humus
 Some amount of air vapour also get into the atmosphere because of various biological activities
 Carbon is incorporated into life-forms through the basic process of photosynthesis which is performed in the presence of Sunlight by all life-forms that contain chlorophyll
 “The temperature of water in air is formed by the heat of the Sun, and the temperature in air form droplets and snow, condensation, hail and other droplets are formed by this heat of sun
 And during the night, it slows down the escape of heat into outer space
 However, some of the factors that created the soil in the first place and brought the soil to the first place may be responsible for the removal of the soil too
 Air above water also gets heated from the surface of the Moon
 All the reactions that take place within our body and within the cells occur between substances that are dissolved in water
The movement of air from one region to the other creates winds
 all the movements of air resulting in diverse atmospheric phenomena are caused by the uneven heating of the upper atmosphere and the uneven cooling of the lower atmosphere.”  The composition of
 If we look at the situation in coastal regions during the day and the air is at the same temperature as the sea, then the air would be warmer than the air and the sea would be at the temperature  of the sea
 At night, both land and sea start to cool
 The type of soil is decided by the average size of particles found in The type of soil and the quality of the soil is decided by the amount of humus and the microscopic organisms found in The type of soil
Life on Earth is dependent on many factors
 Since water cools down slower than the land, the air above water for some reason, gets heated faster and starts rising
 But various other factors also influence these winds – the rotation of the planet, the presence in the paths of the air, the distance of the sun from the Earth and the distance from Earth from the sun, the speed of the winds and the direction and direction of wind are a couple of various other factor
 Humus is a major factor in deciding the soil structure because the soil structure causes the soil to become more porous and allows water and air to penetrate deep underground
 When water bodies are heated during the year, a large amount of water evaporates and goes into the air  above water
 Despite This, the percentage of carbon dioxide in our atmosphere is a mere fraction of a percent because carbon dioxide is ‘fixed’ in two ways: (i) Green plants convert carbon dioxide into glucose in the presence of Sunlight and (ii) many marine animals use carbonates dissolved in sea-water to make (ii) many marine animals shells
 This condensation of water is facilitated if some particles could act as the ‘nucleus’ for these drops to form around
 The availability of water decides not only the number of individuals of each species that are able to survive in a particular area, but The availability of water also decides the diversity of life there
 But when we talk of the oxygen-cycle, we are mainly referring to the cycle that maintains the levels of oxygen in the atmosphere
 Most life-forms we know need an ambient temperature, water, and food
 Living things are found where these three exist
 Water vapour is formed due to the heating of water bodies and the activities of living organisms
 The wind also carries sand from one place to the other like water does
 Removal of useful components from the soil and addition of other substances, which adversely affect the fertility of the soil and kill the diversity of organisms that live in the soil, is called soil pollution
 Despite This, the percentage of carbon dioxide in our atmosphere is a mere fraction of a percent because carbon dioxide is ‘fixed’ in two ways: (i) Green plants convert carbon dioxide into glucose in the presence of Sunlight and (ii) many marine animals use carbonates dissolved in sea-water to make (ii)
 Eukaryotic cells and many prokaryotic cell, discussed in Chapter 5, need oxygen to break down glucose molecules and get energy for oxygen activities
 Some amount of water vapour also get into the atmosphere because of various biological activities
 Another manner in which the temperature of the water in rivers can be affected is when water is released from dams
 But the minerals found in this layer will not be available to Aquatic organisms if the minerals found in this layer are bound up in huge rocks
 This resulted in a reduction of this ozone layer and recently Various man-made compounds like CFCs (carbon compounds having both fluorine and chlorine which are very stable and not degraded by any biological process) have discovered a hole in the ozone layer above the Antartica
 Thus, there is a nitrogen-cycle in nature in which nitrogen passes from its elemental form in the atmosphere into simple molecules in the soil and water, which get converted to more complex molecules in living beings and back again to the simple nitrogen molecule in the atmosphere
The production of oxygen in the form of water vapour is one of the major activities of living organisms
 Oxygen also occurs extensively in the combined form in the Earth’s crust as well as also in the air in the form of carbon dioxide
 Water covers 75% of the Earth’s surface
