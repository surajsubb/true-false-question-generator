 Each kind of cell organelle performs a special function, such as making new material in each such cell, clearing up the waste material from each such cell and so on
 Thus the membrane is selectively permeable meaning water is very osis in water is outside water is movement through water is osis of solution in the membrane
Each living cell has the capacity to perform certain basic functions that are characteristic of all living forms
 The nucleus also plays a crucial part, along with the environment, in determining the way the cell will develop and what form the cell will exhibit at maturity, by directing the chemical activities of the cell
 Foreign materials entering the cell, such as bacteria or food, as well as old organelles end up in the lysosomes, which break complex substances into simpler substances
 Cell organellis are the basic units of life that are found in all living organisms
 Some cells like Amoeba have changing shapes
 In some cases the cell shape could be more or less fixed and peculiar for a particular type of cell; for example, nerve cells have a typical shape
 Leeuwenhoek, with the improved microscope, discovered the free living cells in pond water for the first time
The shape and size of cells are related to the specific function the cell performs
 It was Robert Brown in 1831 who discovered the nucleus in the cell
 This means that different parts of the same body perform different functions
Thus, one function of the ER is to serve as channels for the transport of materials (especially proteins) between various regions of the cytoplasm or between the cytoplasm and the nucleus
 The flexibility of a selectively permeable membrane also enables the cell to engulf in food and other material from its external environment
 In a cell which is not dividing, Functional segments of DNA is present as part of chromatin material
The plasma membrane allows or permits the entry and exit of some materials in and out of each such cell
The plasma membrane allows or permits the entry and exit of some materials in and out of each such water perme through low O2 concentration between  concentration between water and low concentration of water is through diffusion
 The energy required for various chemical activities needed for life is released by mitochondria in the form of ATP (Adenosine triphopshate) molecules
 Viruses lack any membranes and hence do not show characteristics of life until Viruses enter a living body and use a living body cell machinery to multiply
 Cells divide to produce cells of Cells own kind
 Every multi-cellular organism has come from the same cell
 The process by which new cells are made is called cell division
 We know that there is division of labour in multicellular organisms such as human beings
 a revolutionary method of staining individual nerve and cell structures uses a weak solution of silver nitrate and is particularly valuable in tracing the processes and most delicate ramifications of cells
It is interesting that all cells are found to have the same organlles, no matter what all cells function is or what organism all cells have come from
 Again, water crosses the cell membrane in both directions, but this time more water leaves the cell than enters the cell
 In The process of cell division by which most of the cells divide for growth, each cell called mother cell divides to form two identical daughter cells
 The cell theory, that all the plants and animals are composed of cells and that the cell is the basic unit of life, was presented by two biologists, Schleiden and Schwann
If the medium surrounding the cell has a higher water concentration than the cell, meaning that the outside solution is very dilute, the cell will gain water by osmosis
 A cell is able to live and perform all A cell functions because of different components within each such cell
 Similarly, division of humour is also seen within a single cell
Thus water is selectively osis through low concentration between low concentration and high concentration of O2 and O2 enters the cell through diffusion when the O2 is dissolved osis process osis when the concentration the outside such gys role the membrane through water osis from concentration or
 Large and complex cells, including cells from multicellular organisms, need a lot of chemical activities to support Large and complex cells, including cells from multicellular organisms complicated structure and function.
 a revolutionary method of staining individual nerve and cell structures is referred to as the ‘black reaction’
 As soon as there is a difference of concentration of CO2 inside and outside a cell, CO2 moves out of the region of high concentration, to a region of low concentration
The cell theory, that all the plants and animals are composed of cells and that the cell is the basic unit of life was further expanded by Virchow by suggesting that all cells arise from pre-existing cells
 Some of these proteins and lipids help in building a membrane around it
 Each kind of cell organelle performs a special function, such as making new material in each such phone, making new materials in each cell, clearing up the waste material from each such cells and so On
 Therefore, lysosomes are also known as the ‘suicide bags’ of a cell
 In some organisms like bacteria, the nuclear region of the cell may be poorly defined due to the absence of a nuclear membrane
 The nucleus plays a central role in cellular reproduction, the process by which a single cell divides and forms two new cells
Cells were first discovered by Robert Hooke in 1665
 On the other hand, many cells group together in a single body and assume different functions in many cells are group together to form various body parts in multiellular organisms (multi = many) such as some fungi, plants and animal
 the human body has a heart to pump blood, a stomach to digest food and so on
 In the cell’s external environment, the concentration of substance like carbon dioxide (which is cellular waste and requires to be excreted out by the cell) accumulates in high concentrations inside the cell as compared to that inside the cells
In some cases the cell shape could be more or less fixed and peculiar for a particular type of cell; for example, nerve cells have a typical shape
 Purkinje in 1839 coined the term ‘protoplasm’ for the fluid substance that is found in the nucleus of a cell and he also coined the word ‘membrane’ to refer to the membrane that surrounds the nucleus
Something similar to this happens in cells when, for example, some substance like CO2 (which is cellular waste and requires to be excreted out by the cell) accumulates in high concentrations inside the cell
Something similar to this happens in cells when, for example when CO2 is in high concentration inside a cell but in low concentration outside the cell, the substance like CO2 can move out of a membrane by a process called diffusion
 All the cells are composed by the nucleus, which is the
 Different molecules move in and out of the cell through a type of transport requiring use of energy
Thus the plasma membrane also prevents movement of some other materials
 With the discovery of the electron microscope in 1940, it was possible to observe and understand the complex structure of the cell and it various organelles
 In the cell’s external environment, the concentration of CO2 is low as compared to that inside the cell
 membranes often have connections with the membranes of the ER and therefore constitute another portion of a complex cellular membrane system
 cells are called unicellular organism (uni = single)
 On the other hand, many cells group together in a single body and assume different functions in many cells group together in a single body to form various body parts in multicellular organisms (multi = many) such as some fungi, plants and animals
 If the medium has exactly the same water concentration as the cell, there will be no net movement of water across the cell membrane
