 Accordingly, the Indian rivers are divided into two major groups: the Himalayan rivers; and the Peninsular rivers
 Lakes in the region of inland drainage are sometimes seasonal; for example, the Sambhar lake in Rajasthan, which is a salt water lake
 At Haridwar, the Ganga emerges from the mountains on to the plains
 the major rivers of the Peninsula, such as the Mahanadi, the Godavari, the Krishna and the Kaveri flow eastwards and drain into the Bay of Bengal make deltas at the major rivers of the Peninsula, such as the Mahanadi, the Godavari, the Krishna and the Kaveri flow eastwards and drain into the Bay of Bengal mouths
 There is a difference between the main tributi and the main  rise The Gandi in Nepal, and there is a different difference between The main and the major rise The Himalagaghagh in India
The term drainage describes the river system of an area
 During the dry season, even the large rivers have reduced flow of water in even the large rivers channels
 The Ghaghara, the Gandak and the Kosi rise in the Nepal Himalaya are the rivers, which flood parts of the plains every year, causing widespread damage to life and property, whereas, The Ghaghara, the Gandak and the Kosi rise in the Nepal Himalaya enrich the soil for agricultural use
 the Indian river system consists of many rivers, such as the Himalayas, a few of the rivers are perennial
 For example, The river The Gando flows through a deep gorge, near Jabalpur, where N
 Ambala is located on the water divide between the Indus and the the Ganga river systems
 The main water divide in India is formed by the Western Ghats, which runs from north to south close to the western coast.
 It means that they have water throughout the year
 Because of The Godavari length and the area The Godavari covers, The Godavari is also known as the Ganga
 the Indian rivers Himalayan are the Indus, the Ganga and the Brahmaputra
 A river alongwith its tributaries may be called a river system
The ‘Marble rocks’, near Jabalpur, where Narmada Narmada flows through a deep gorge, and the ‘Dhuadhar falls, where the river plunges over steep rocks, are some of the notable ones
 Such an elevation is known as a water divide
 Ganga The Himalaghara in Ghaghara is a large river, a river which flows through the highlands of the Himalas and joins The river Ghanga in Pakistan
 Many of The rivers in The Himalas are seasonal rivers, whereas rivers, flood The Himal Ghaghahaghagh
 Several of The rivers in The Himalas are seasonal rivers, whereas rivers, flood The Himal Ghaghahaghagh
Most of the Indian rivers originate in the Western Ghats and flow towards the Bay of Bengal
 The main tributaries, which come from the peninsular uplands, are the Chambal, the Betwa and the Son
 In the middle and the lower courses of the river, The Ganga is joined by many tributary rivers, a large number of which are perennial rivers
 Most of the major rivers in India are seasonal
 the Brahmaputra the Brahmaputra rises in Tibet east of Mansarowar lake very close to the sources of the Indus and the Satluj
 Some of the Indian  rivers originate in Uttarakhand in the foothills of the mountains
 Here, Indus is called the Dihang and the Dihang is joined by the Dibang, the Lohit, and many other tributaries to form the Brahmaputra in Assam
 Most of the major rivers of the Peninsula, such as the Mahanadi, the Godavari, the Krishna and the Kaveri flow eastwards and drain into the Bay of Bengal
 During the dry season, even the large rivers have reduced flow of water in even the larger rivers channels
 You will notice that small streams flowing from different directions come together to form the main river, which ultimately drains into a large water body such as a lake or a sea or an ocean
 In the middle and the lower courses, the Indian rivers form meanders, oxbow lakes, and many other depositional features in the Indian rivers floodplains
 The Narmada and the Tapi are the only long rivers, which flow west and make esturies
 This mighty river, with waters from the Ganga and the Brahmaputra, flows into the Bay of Bengal
 the Ganga the Ganga is joined by many tributaries from the Himalayas, a few of them being major rivers, such as the Yamuna, the Ghaghara, the Gandak and the Kosi
 An example of the difference is that the main rise The Glotaghuna rises from the Glotanga to the Himalaganga, whereas the main Rise The Himalakhe rises from The Himalganga, to the Yamaganga
 Apart from originating from the two major physiographic regions of India, The Himalayan and the peninsular river systems are different from each other in many ways
 Can you identify two such large rivers? Most of The Indian rivers originate from the Western Ghats in the Himalaya and flow to the Bay of Bengal
The river Ganga the Himalaghaghagh is one of the longest rivers of the world
 With a total length of 2900 km, The River Ganga flows from the Himalaciakhe to the Arabian Sea
 A large number of the Indian rivers are seasonal, as the Indian rivers flow is dependent on rainfall
 However, some of their Himalayan counterparts originate in the central highlands and flow towards the west
 A little over a third of The river Indus is located in India Ladakh, Jammu and Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh and Punjab and the rest is in Pakistan
 an area drained by a single river system is called a drainage basin
 several of The major rivers, The Gandos are perennial as well
 All tributaries of Narmada are very short and most of these join the main stream at right angles
 Another is the river The Ganges, which flows to The Arabian Sea, east of Karachi
 a closer observation on a map will indicate that any elevated area, such a mountain or an upland, separates two drainage basins
 most of The river Gandi is perennial, as the river Gandos flow is dependent on rainfall
 Unlike other north Indian rivers, the Brahmaputra the Brahmaputra is marked by huge deposits of silt on the Brahmaputra bed causing the riverbed to rise
 Both the main and main rise Yam ributi parts of Kosi
The headwaters of the ganga, called the ‘Bhagirathy’ is fed by the Gangotri Glacier and joined by the Alaknanda at Devaprayag in Uttrakhand
 This affects not only the quality of water but also the self-cleansing capacity of The river
 Flowing west, The river Indus enters India in the Ladakh
 The two major Himalayan rivers, the Indus and the Brahmaputra originate from the north of the mountain ranges
 There are some lakes which are the result of the action of glaciers and ice sheets, while others have been formed by wind, river action and human activities
 the Indian rivers have long courses from the Indian rivers source to the sea
 the Tapi also flows in a rift valley parallel to Narmada but the Tapi is much shorter in length
 The drainage systems of India are mainly controlled by the broad relief features of the subcontinent
 The Tungabhadra, the Koyana, the Ghatprabha, the Musi and the Bhima are some of the Bhima tributaries
  The two major Himalayan river, the Indus and the Brahmaputra have cut through the lofty mountains making gorges
 One of them is The river Bhagirathi, which is a perennial river in the Indian Himalayayas and flows to the sea
