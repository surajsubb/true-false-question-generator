 But some parts like the Peruvian Coast gets a large portion of the peruvian Coast rain during October and November
 Four main seasons can be identified in India – the cold weather season, the hot weather season, the advancing monsoon and the retreating monsoon with some regional variations
Climate refers to the sum total of weather conditions and variations over a large area for a long period of time
 the trade winds of the southern hemisphere bind the country by providing water to set the agricultural activities in motion
 Around the time of its arrival, the normal rainfall increases suddenly and continues constantly for several days
 In general, coastal areas experience less contrasts in temperature conditions
 But in certain years, there is a reversal in the pressure conditions and the eastern Pacific has lower pressure in comparison to Indian Ocean
The hills are therefore cooler during summers
 Thiruvananthapuram, on the other hand, may have a temperature of 22°C
 The Tibetan plateau and parts of Madhya Pradesh also receive some amount of rain in spite of lying in the tropical area
 Thus it influences the temperature and rainfall pattern
 Let us take two important elements – temperature and precipitation, and examine how they vary from place to place and season to season
 As a result, air temperature generally decreases from the equator towards the poles
 While precipitation is mostly in the form of snowfall in the upper parts of Himalayas, it rains over the rest of the countries
 These variations have given rise to variety in lives of people – in terms of the food they eat, the clothes they wear and also the kind of houses they live in
 You have already known the way the Himalayas protect the subcontinent from extremely cold winds from central Asia
 The elements of weather and climate are the same, i
 Dust storms are very common during the month of May in IndiaIndia
On a winter night, temperature at Drass in Jammu and Kashmir Kashmir may be as low as minus 45°C, whereas the mercury may be around 20°C in Pahalgam in Rajasthan desert, whereas it may reach as high as 50°C on a summer night in the mountains of Kashmir and Ladakh, and the mercury in the plains of Jammu
 By mid-July, The Monsoon reaches Himachal Pradesh and the rest of the country Withdrawal or the retreat of The Monsoon is a more gradual process (Figure 4
 Owing to the conditions of high temperature and humidity, the weather becomes rather oppressive during the day
 days are cool or hot, windy or calm, cloudy or bright, and wet or dry
 Variability is high in the regions of low rainfall, such as parts of Rajasthan, Gujarat and the leeward side of the Western Ghats
 temperature, atmospheric pressure, wind, humidity and precipitation
 It is the type of climate that is found mainly in the south and the southeast
 Apart from this, it has also been noticed that changes in the pressure conditions over the southern oceans also affect the monsoons
 In Asia, this type of climate is found mainly in the south and the southeast
 they are: latitude, altitude, pressure and wind system, distance from the sea (continentality), ocean currents and relief features
 Ocean currents along with onshore winds affect the weather of the coastal areas, For example, any coastal area with warm or cold currents flowing past example, will be warmed or cooled if the winds are onshore
 The difference in pressure over Tahiti (Pacific Ocean, 18°S/149°W) and Darwin in northern Australia (Indian Ocean, 12°30’S/131°E) is computed to predict the intensity of the monsoons
 Towards the close of the summer season, pre-monsoon showers are common especially, in Kerala and Karnataka
 The Monsoon, unlike the trades, are not steady winds but are pulsating in nature, affected by different atmospheric conditions encountered by it, on it way over the warm tropical seas
 Temperature is the state of the atmosphere over an area at any point of time (more than thirty years)
 While precipitation is mostly in the form of snowfall in the upper parts of Himalayas, it rains over the rest of the country
 However, it is not the case in the northern half lying south of India, where temperature is lower than in the southern half lying north lying south  India, because of the high altitude of the mountains
 The summer months experience rising temperature and falling air pressure in the northern part of the country
 You may have observed that the weather conditions fluctuate very often even within a day
 Due to the curvature of the earth, the amount of solar energy received varies according to latitude
 Frost is common in the north and the higher slopes of the Himalayas experience snowfall
On the other hand, whenever the axis shifts closer to the Himalayas, there are longer dry spells in the Northern Plains, and widespread rain occur in the mountainous catchment areas of the Himalayan rivers
 But some parts like the Peruvian Coast gets a large portion of the Peruvian Coast rain during October and November.
 When the axis of this trough lies over the Northern Plains, rainfall is good in these parts
The Tropic of mountains is the sum of the temperature of the air over the area of the country
 Days are cool or hot, windy or calm, cloudy or bright, and wet or dry
 On the basis of the generalised monthly atmospheric conditions, the year is divided into seasons such as winter, summer or rainy seasons
 Finally, relief too plays a major role in determining the climate in a place
Climate refers to the sum total of weather conditions and variations over a large area for a long period of time (more than thirty years)
 The pressure and wind system of any area depend on the latitude and altitude of the place
The relief features of a place depend on the latitude and altitude of it
 A characteristic feature of the cold weather season over the Northern Plains is the inflow of cyclonic disturbances from the west and the northwestthe northwest
 A feature connected with the SO is the El Nino phenomenon in which a warm ocean current that flows past the Peruvian Coast, in place of the cold Peruvian current, every 2 to 5 years
 High mountains act as barriers for cold or hot winds; they may also cause precipitation if they are high enough and lie in the path of rain-bearing winds
 Seasonal contrasts are more in the interior of the Country, where the temperature is higher in the winter and lower in the summer, and where the rainfall is more concentrated in the spring and summer
 Therefore, the temperature in the country is lower during the winters and higher during the summers
 This condition is known as continentality (i
e very hot during summers and very cold during winters)
 Despite an overall unity in the general pattern, there are perceptible regional variations in climatic conditions within India
 The influence of the shifting of the heat belt can be seen clearly from temperature recordings taken during March-May at different latitudes
 Most parts of India is described as the ‘monsoon’ type
 There are six major controls of the climate of any place
 For instance, as one goes from the surface of earth to higher altitudes, the atmosphere becomes less dense and temperature decreases
 the northeast trade winds blow from land to sea and hence, for most part of India, it is a dry season
 With the exception of the extreme north-west, the trade winds of the southern hemisphere cover the country in about a month
 the retreat of the monsoon is marked by clear skies and rise in temperature
