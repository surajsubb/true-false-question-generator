activities, energy and raw material are needed', ' Food is a necessity for cell and tissue functions', ' Anything that prevents proper functioning of cells and tissues will lead to a lack of proper activity of the body', ' It is in this context that we will look at the notions of health and disease', ' we have heard the word ‘health’ used quite frequently', ' we use the word ‘health’ used quite frequently we as well, when we say things like ‘my grandmother’s health is not good’', ' Our teachers use the word ‘health’ used quite frequently when Our teachers scold we saying ‘this is not a healthy attitude’', ' If we think about this, we realise that this always implies the idea of ‘being well’', ' we can think of this well-being as effective functioning', ' For we grandmothers, being able to go out to the market or to visit neighbours is ‘being well’, and not being able to do such things is ‘poor health’', ' Being interested in following the teaching in the classroom so that we can understand the world is a ‘healthy attitude’; while not being interested is considered the opposite', ' ‘Health’ is therefore a state of being well enough to function well physically, mentally and socially', ' If health means a state of physical, mental and social well-being, it cannot be something that each one of us can achieve entirely on us own', ' The health of all organisms will depend on all organisms surroundings or all organisms environment', ' The environment includes the physical environment', ' So, for example, health is at risk in a cyclone in many ways', ' Human beings live in societies', ' Our social environment, therefore, is an important factor in our individual health', ' Our live in villages, towns or cities', ' In such places, even Our physical environment is decided by our social environment', ' Our need food to be healthy, and food will have to be earned by doing work', ' For this, the opportunity to do work has to be available', ' We need to be happy in order to be truly healthy, and if We mistreat each other and are afraid of each other, We cannot be happy or healthy', ' Social equality and harmony are therefore necessary for individual health', ' We can think of many other such examples of connections between community issues and individual health', ' Disease, in other words, literally means being uncomfortable', ' However, the word is used in a more limited meaning', ' We talk of Disease when We can find a specific and particular cause for discomfort', ' This does not mean that We have to know the absolute final cause; We can say that someone is suffering from diarrhoea without knowing exactly what has caused the loose motions', ' We can now easily see that it is possible to be in poor health without actually suffering from a particular disease', ' Simply not being diseased is not the same as being healthy', ' ‘Good health’ for a dancer may mean being able to stretch Good health’ for a dancer body into difficult but graceful

musician/a musician flute', ' To have the opportunity to realise the unique potential in all of us is also necessary for real health', ' us can be in poor health without there being a simple cause in the form of an identifiable disease', ' This is the reason why, when us think about health, us think about societies and communities', ' On the other hand, when us think about disease, us think about individual sufferers', ' These tissues make up physiological systems or organ systems that carry out body functions', ' Each of the organ systems has specific organs as the organ systems parts, and the organ systems has particular functions', ' So, the organ systems has the stomach and intestines, and the organ systems helps to digest food taken in from outside the body', ' The musculoskeletal system, which is made up of bones and muscles, holds the body parts together and helps the body move', ' When there is a disease, either the functioning of one or more systems of the body will change for the worse', ' These changes give rise to symptoms and signs of disease', ' Symptoms of disease are the things we feel as being ‘wrong’', ' So we have a headache, we have cough, we have loose motions, we have a wound with pus; these are all symptoms', ' These indicate that there may be a disease, but These don’t indicate what disease is', ' For example, a headache may mean just examination stress or, very rarely, a headache may mean meningitis, or any one of a dozen different diseases', ' Signs of disease are what physicians will look for on the basis of the symptoms', ' Signs will give a little more definite indication of the presence of a particular disease', ' Physicians will also get laboratory tests done to pinpoint disease further', ' The manifestations of disease will be different depending on a number of factors', ' Some diseases last for only very short periods of time, and Some diseases are called acute diseases', ' We all know from experience that the common cold lasts only a few days', ' Other ailments can last for a long time, even as much as a lifetime, and are called chronic diseases', ' An example is the infection causing elephantiasis, which is very common in some parts of India', ' Acute and chronic diseases have different effects on our health', ' Any disease that causes poor functioning of some part of the body will affect our health', ' This is because all functions of the body are necessary for being healthy', ' But an acute disease, which is over very soon, will not have time to cause major effects on general health, while a chronic disease will do so', ' As an example, think about a cough and cold, which all of us have from time to time', ' Most of us get better and become well within a week or so', ' And there are no lasting effects on our health', ' But if we get infected with a chronic disease such as tuberculosis of the lungs, then being ill over the years does make us lose weight and feel tired all the time', ' us may not go to school for a few days if us have an acute disease', ' But a chronic disease will make a chronic disease difficult for us to follow what is being taught in school and reduce us ability to learn', ' In other words, we are likely to have prolonged general poor health if we have an acute disease', ' Chronic diseases therefore, have very drastic long-term effects on people’s health as compared to acute diseases', ' As we have seen, it is important to keep public health and community health factors in mind when we think about causes of diseases', ' We can take that approach a little further', ' that approach is useful to think of the immediate causes of disease as belonging to two distinct types', ' One group of causes is the infectious agents, mostly microbes or micro-organisms', ' Diseases where microbes are the immediate causes are called infectious diseases', ' This is because the microbes can spread in the community, and the diseases the microbes cause will spread with the microbes', ' On the other hand, there are also diseases that are not caused by infectious agents', ' infectious agents causes vary, but infectious agents are not external causes like microbes that can spread in the community', ' Instead, these are mostly internal, non-infectious causes', ' For example, some cancers are caused by genetic abnormalities', ' High blood pressure can be caused by excessive weight and lack of exercise', ' Similarly, diabetes is not infectious', ' You can think of many other diseases where the immediate causes will not be infectious', ' The ways in which diseases spread, and the ways in which diseases can be treated and prevented at the community level would be different for different diseases', ' This would depend a lot on whether the immediate causes are infectious or non-infectious', ' Organisms that can cause disease are found in a wide range of such categories of classification', ' Some of the immediate causes are infectious or non-infectious are viruses, some are bacteria, some are fungi, some are single-celled animals or protozoans', ' Some diseases are also caused by multicellular organisms, such as worms of different kinds', ' Common examples of diseases caused by viruses are the common cold, influenza, dengue fever and AIDS', ' Diseases like typhoid fever, cholera, tuberculosis and anthrax are caused by bacteria', ' Many common skin infections are caused by different kinds of fungi', ' Protozoan microbes cause many familiar diseases, such as malaria and kalaazar', ' All of us have also come across intestinal worm infections, as well as diseases like elephantiasis caused by different species of worms', ' These categories are important factors in deciding what kind of treatment to use', ' Members of each one of these groups – viruses, bacteria, and so on – have many biological characteristics in common', ' All viruses, for example, live inside host cells, whereas bacteria very rarely do', ' Viruses, bacteria and fungi multiply very quickly, while worms multiply very slowly in comparison', ' Taxonomically, all bacteria are closely related to each other than to viruses and vice versa', ' This means that many important life processes are similar in the bacteria group but are not shared with the virus group', ' As a result, drugs that block one of these life processes in one member of the virus group is likely to be effective against many other members of the virus group', ' But the same drug will not work against a microbe belonging to a different group', ' As an example, let us take antibiotics', ' antibiotics commonly block biochemical pathways important for bacteria', ' Many bacteria, for example, make a cell-wall to protect Many bacteria', ' The antibiotic penicillin blocks the bacterial processes that build the cellwall', ' As a result, Many bacteria become unable to make cell-walls, and die easily', ' Human cells don’t make a cell-wall anyway, so Penicillin cannot have such an effect on us', ' Penicillin will have this effect on any bacteria that use such processes for making cell-walls', ' Similarly, many antibiotics work against many species of bacteria rather than simply working against one', ' But viruses do not use these pathways at all, and that is the reason why antibiotics do not work against viral infections', ' If we have a common cold, taking antibiotics does not reduce the severity or the duration of disease', ' However, if we also get a bacterial infection along with the viral cold, taking antibiotics will help', ' Even then, we also get a bacterial infection along with the viral cold will work only against the bacterial part of a bacterial infection, not the viral infection', ' Many microbial agents can commonly move from an affected person to someone else in a variety of ways', ' In other words, Many microbial agents can be ‘communicated’, and so are also called communicable diseases', ' Such disease-causing microbes can spread through the air', ' This occurs through the little droplets thrown out by an infected person who sneezes or coughs (Fig', ' 13', '2)', ' Someone standing close by can breathe in these droplets, and Such disease-causing microbes get a chance to start a new infection', ' Examples of such diseases spread through the air are the common cold, coronavirus disease (COVID-19), pneumonia and tuberculosis', ' We all have had the experience of sitting near someone suffering from a cold and catching someone suffering from a cold We all', ' Obviously, the more crowded We all living conditions are, the more likely it is that such airborne diseases will spread', ' Diseases can also be spread through water', ' This occurs if the excreta from someone suffering from an infectious gut disease, such as cholera, get mixed with the drinking water used by people living nearby', ' The choleracausing microbes will enter a healthy person through the water The choleracausing microbes drink and cause disease in The choleracausing microbes', ' Such diseases are much more likely to spread in the absence of safe supplies of drinking water', ' The sexual act is one of the closest physical contact two people can have with each other', ' Not surprisingly, there are microbial infections such as syphilis or AIDS that are transmitted by sexual contact from one partner to the other', ' However, such sexually transmitted diseases are not spread by casual physical contact', ' Casual physical contacts include handshakes or hugs or sports, like wrestling, or by any of the other ways in which we touch each other socially', ' Other than the sexual contact, the virus causing AIDS (HIV) can also spread through blood-to-blood contact with infected people or from an infected mother to an infected mother baby during pregnancy or through breast feeding', ' We live in an environment that is full of many other creatures apart from We', ' It is inevitable that many diseases will be transmitted by other animals', ' other animals carry the infecting agents from a sick person to another potential host', ' other animals are thus the intermediaries and are called vectors', ' The commonest vectors we all know are mosquitoes', ' In many species of mosquitoes, the females need highly nutritious food in the form of blood in order to be able to lay mature eggs', ' Mosquitoes feed on many warm-blooded animals, including us', ' In this way, Mosquitoes can transfer diseases from person to person', ' The disease-causing microbes enter the body through these different means', ' Different species of microbes seem to have evolved to home in on different parts of the body', ' In part, this selection is connected to Different species of microbes point of entry', ' If Different species of microbes enter from the air via the nose, Different species of microbes are likely to go to the lungs', ' This is seen in the bacteria causing tuberculosis', ' If Different species of microbes enter through the mouth, Different species of microbes can stay in the gut lining like the bacteria causing tuberculosis', ' Or Different species of microbes can go to the liver, like the viruses that cause jaundice', ' But this needn’t always be the case', ' An infection like HIV, that comes into the body via the sexual organs, will spread to lymph nodes all over the body', ' Malaria-causing microbes, entering through a mosquito bite, will go to the liver, and then to the red blood cells', ' The virus causing Japanese encephalitis, or brain fever, will similarly enter through a mosquito bite', ' But a mosquito bite goes on to infect the brain', ' The signs and symptoms of a disease will thus depend on the tissue or organ which the microbe targets', ' If the lungs are the targets, then symptoms will be cough and breathlessness', ' If the liver is targeted, there will be jaundice', ' If the brain is the target, we will observe headaches, vomiting, fits or unconsciousness', ' We can imagine what the symptoms and signs of an infection will be if we know what the target tissue or organ is, and the functions that are carried out by this tissue or organ', ' In addition to these tissue-specific effects of infectious disease, there will be other common effects too', ' Most of other common effects depend on the fact that the body’s immune system is activated in response to infection', ' An active immune system recruits many cells to the affected tissue to kill off The disease-causing microbes', ' This recruitment process is called inflammation', ' As a part of This recruitment process, there are local effects such as swelling and pain, and general effects such as fever', ' In some cases, the tissue-specificity of the infection leads to very general-seeming effects', ' For example, in HIV infection, HIV infection goes to An active immune system and damages HIV infection function', ' Thus, many of the effects of HIV-AIDS are because the body can no longer fight off the many minor infections that we face everyday', ' Instead, every small cold can become pneumonia', ' Similarly, a minor gut infection can produce major diarrhoea with blood loss', ' Ultimately, it is these other infections that kill people suffering from HIV-AIDS', ' It is also important to remember that the severity of disease manifestations depend on the number of microbes in the body', ' If the number of microbes in the body is very small, the disease manifestations may be minor or unnoticed', ' But if the number of microbes in the body is of the same microbe large, disease can be severe enough to be lifethreatening', ' An active immune system is a major factor that determines the number of microbes surviving in the body', ' There are two ways to treat an infectious disease', ' One would be to reduce the effects of the disease and the other to kill the cause of disease', ' For the first, we can provide treatment that will reduce the symptoms', ' the symptoms are usually because of inflammation', ' For example, we can take medicines that bring down fever, reduce pain or loose motions', ' We can take bed rest so that We can conserve We energy', ' This will enable We to have more of This available to focus on healing', ' But this kind of symptom-directed treatment by This will not make the infecting microbe go away and disease will not be cured', ' For that, We need to be able to kill off The disease-causing microbes', ' One way is to use medicines that kill microbes', ' We have seen earlier that microbes can be classified into different categories', ' microbes can be classified into different categories are viruses, bacteria, fungi or protozoa', ' Each of microbes can be classified into different categories will have some essential biochemical life process which is peculiar to that group and not shared with the other groups', ' These processes may be pathways for the synthesis of new substances or respiration', ' pathways for the synthesis of new substances or respiration will not be used by us either', ' For example, our cells may make new substances by a mechanism different from that used by bacteria', ' We have to find a drug that blocks the bacterial synthesis pathway without affecting We own', ' This is what is achieved by the antibiotics that We are all familiar with', ' Similarly, there are drugs that kill protozoa such as the malarial parasite', ' One reason why making anti-viral medicines is harder than making antibacterial medicines is that viruses have few biochemical mechanisms of viruses own', ' viruses enter our cells and use our machinery for viruses life processes', ' This means that there are relatively few virus-specific targets to aim at', ' Despite this limitation, there are now effective anti-viral drugs, for example, the drugs that keep HIV infection under control', ' There are three limitations of this approach to dealing with infectious disease', ' The first is that once someone has a disease, their body functions are damaged and may never recover completely', ' The second is that treatment will take time, which means that someone suffering from a disease is likely to be bedridden for some time even if we can give proper treatment', ' The third is that the person suffering from an infectious disease can serve as the source from where the infection may spread to other people', ' This leads to the multiplication of the above difficulties', ' It is because of such reasons that prevention of diseases is better than diseases cure', ' If we look at the means of diseases spreading, we can get some easy answers', ' For airborne microbes and those carried by droplets, we can prevent exposure by providing living conditions that are not overcrowded, maintaining appropriate physical distance, wearing appropriate masks, practising hand hygiene, etc', ' For water-borne microbes, we can prevent exposure by providing safe drinking water', ' This can be done by treating safe drinking water to kill any microbial contamination', ' For vector-borne infections, we can provide clean environments', ' This would not, for example, allow mosquito breeding', ' In other words, public hygiene is one basic key to the prevention of infectious diseases', ' In addition to these issues that relate to the environment, there are some other general principles to prevent infectious diseases', ' To appreciate some other general principles to prevent infectious diseases, let us ask a question us have not looked at so far', ' Normally, us are faced with infections everyday', ' If someone is suffering from a cold and cough in the class, it is likely that the children sitting around will be exposed to the infection', ' But all of the children sitting around do not actually suffer from disease', ' An active immune system is normally fighting off microbes', ' our have cells that specialise in killing infecting microbes', ' cells that specialise in killing infecting microbes go into action each time infecting microbes enter the body', ' If cells that specialise in killing infecting microbes are successful, our do not actually come down with any disease', ' cells that specialise in killing infecting microbes manage to kill off the infection long before the infection assumes major proportions', ' As our noted earlier, if the number of the infecting microbes is controlled, the manifestations of disease will be minor', ' In other words, becoming exposed to or infected with an infectious microbe does not necessarily mean developing noticeable disease', ' So, one way of looking at severe infectious diseases is that severe infectious diseases represents a lack of success of An active immune system', ' The functioning of An active immune system, like any other system in our body, will not be good if proper and sufficient nourishment and food is not available', ' Therefore, the second basic principle of prevention of infectious disease is the availability of proper and sufficient food for everyone', ' The specific ways of preventing infections relate to a peculiar property of the immune system that usually fights off microbial infections', ' Let us cite an example to try and understand a peculiar property of the immune system that usually fights off microbial infections', ' These days, there is no smallpox anywhere in the world', ' But as recently as a hundred years ago, smallpox epidemics were not at all uncommon', ' In such an epidemic, people used to be very afraid of coming near someone suffering from disease since people were afraid of catching disease', ' However, there was one group of people who did not have this fear', ' one group of people who did not have this fear would provide nursing care for the victims of smallpox', ' This was a group of people who had had smallpox earlier and survived This, although with a lot of scarring', ' In other words, if you had smallpox once, there was

disease can be severe enough to be lifethreatening.  We can imagine what the symptoms and signs of an infection will be if we know what the target tissue or organ is, and the functions that are carried out by this tissue or organ.  us can be in poor health without there being a simple cause in the form of an identifiable disease.  Obviously, the more crowded We all living conditions are, the more likely it is that such airborne diseases will spread.  The ways in which diseases spread, and the ways in which diseases can be treated and prevented at the community level would be different for different diseases.  that approach is useful to think of the immediate causes of disease as belonging to two distinct types.  You can think of many other diseases where the immediate causes will not be infectious.  We can now see that, as a general principle, we can ‘fool’ An active immune system into developing a memory for a particular infection by putting something, that mimics the microbe we want to vaccinate against, into the body.  The third is that the person suffering from an infectious disease can serve as the source from where the infection may spread to other people.  We can now easily see that it is possible to be in poor health without actually suffering from a particular disease.  Thus, many of the effects of HIV-AIDS are because the body can no longer fight off the many minor infections that we face everyday.  Let us cite an example to try and understand a peculiar property of the immune system that usually fights off microbial infections.  But this kind of symptom-directed treatment by This will not make the infecting microbe go away and disease will not be cured.  But an acute disease, which is over very soon, will not have time to cause major effects on general health, while a chronic disease will do so.  This means that many important life processes are similar in the bacteria group but are not shared with the virus group.  If we have a common cold, taking antibiotics does not reduce the severity or the duration of disease.  Each of microbes can be classified into different categories will have some essential biochemical life process which is peculiar to that group and not shared with the other groups.  If the number of microbes in the body is very small, the disease manifestations may be minor or unnoticed.  If someone is suffering from a cold and cough in the class, it is likely that the children sitting around will be exposed to the infection.  But if we get infected with a chronic disease such as tuberculosis of the lungs, then being ill over the years does make us lose weight and feel tired all the time.  As a result, drugs that block one of these life processes in one member of the virus group is likely to be effective against many other members of the virus group.  This would depend a lot on whether the immediate causes are infectious or non-infectious.  As our noted earlier, if the number of the infecting microbes is controlled, the manifestations of disease will be minor.  Most of other common effects depend on the fact that the body’s immune system is activated in response to infection.  In addition to these tissue-specific effects of infectious disease, there will be other common effects too.  One would be to reduce the effects of the disease and the other to kill the cause of disease.  When there is a disease, either the functioning of one or more systems of the body will change for the worse.  The signs and symptoms of a disease will thus depend on the tissue or organ which the microbe targets.  Many microbial agents can commonly move from an affected person to someone else in a variety of ways.  But viruses do not use these pathways at all, and that is the reason why antibiotics do not work against viral infections.\n","\n","***ROUGE Score***\n","\n","[{'rouge-1': {'r': 0.26003824091778205, 'p': 1.0, 'f': 0.41274658246029655}, 'rouge-2': {'r': 0.17952964557800596, 'p': 0.954225352112676, 'f': 0.3022023948811964}, 'rouge-l': {'r': 0.26003824091778205, 'p': 1.0, 'f': 0.41274658246029655}}]\n","2023-03-15 15:51:22.451029: I tensorflow/core/platform/cpu_feature_guard.cc:193] This TensorFlow binary is optimized with oneAPI Deep Neural Network Library (oneDNN) to use the following CPU instructions in performance-critical operations:  AVX2 FMA\n","To enable them in other operations, rebuild TensorFlow with the appropriate compiler flags.\n","2023-03-15 15:51:23.334783: W tensorflow/compiler/xla/stream_executor/platform/default/dso_loader.cc:64] Could not load dynamic library 'libnvinfer.so.7'; dlerror: libnvinfer.so.7: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory; LD_LIBRARY_PATH: /usr/lib64-nvidia\n","2023-03-15 15:51:23.334943: W tensorflow/compiler/xla/stream_executor/platform/default/dso_loader.cc:64] Could not load dynamic library 'libnvinfer_plugin.so.7'; dlerror: libnvinfer_plugin.so.7: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory; LD_LIBRARY_PATH: /usr/lib64-nvidia\n","2023-03-15 15:51:23.334983: W tensorflow/compiler/tf2tensorrt/utils/py_utils.cc:38] TF-TRT Warning: Cannot dlopen some TensorRT libraries.

blocks the bacterial processes that build the cellwall', ' As a result, Many bacteria become unable to make cell-walls, and die easily', ' Human cells don’t make a cell-wall anyway, so Penicillin cannot have such an effect on us', ' Penicillin will have this effect on any bacteria that use such processes for making cell-walls', ' Similarly, many antibiotics work against many species of bacteria rather than simply working against one', ' But viruses do not use these pathways at all, and that is the reason why antibiotics do not work against viral infections', ' If we have a common cold, taking antibiotics does not reduce the severity or the duration of disease', ' However, if we also get a bacterial infection along with the viral cold, taking antibiotics will help', ' Even then, we also get a bacterial infection along with the viral cold will work only against the bacterial part of a bacterial infection, not the viral infection', ' Many microbial agents can commonly move from an affected person to someone else in a variety of ways', ' In other words, Many microbial agents can be ‘communicated’, and so are also called communicable diseases', ' Such disease-causing microbes can spread through the air', ' This occurs through the little droplets thrown out by an infected person who sneezes or coughs (Fig', ' 13', '2)', ' Someone standing close by can breathe in these droplets, and Such disease-causing microbes get a chance to start a new infection', ' Examples of such diseases spread through the air are the common cold, coronavirus disease (COVID-19), pneumonia and tuberculosis', ' We all have had the experience of sitting near someone suffering from a cold and catching someone suffering from a cold We all', ' Obviously, the more crowded We all living conditions are, the more likely it is that such airborne diseases will spread', ' Diseases can also be spread through water', ' This occurs if the excreta from someone suffering from an infectious gut disease, such as cholera, get mixed with the drinking water used by people living nearby', ' The choleracausing microbes will enter a healthy person through the water The choleracausing microbes drink and cause disease in The choleracausing microbes', ' Such diseases are much more likely to spread in the absence of safe supplies of drinking water', ' The sexual act is one of the closest physical contact two people can have with each other', ' Not surprisingly, there are microbial infections such as syphilis or AIDS that are transmitted by sexual contact from one partner to the other', ' However, such sexually transmitted diseases are not spread by casual physical contact', ' Casual physical contacts include handshakes or hugs or sports, like wrestling, or by any of the other ways in which we touch each other socially', ' Other than the sexual contact, the virus causing AIDS (HIV) can also spread through blood-to-blood contact with infected people or from an infected mother to an infected mother baby during pregnancy or through breast feeding', ' We live in an environment that is full of many other creatures apart from We', ' It is inevitable that many diseases will be transmitted by other animals', ' other animals carry the infecting agents from a sick person to another potential host', ' other animals are thus the intermediaries and are called vectors', ' The commonest vectors we all know are mosquitoes', ' In many species of mosquitoes, the females need highly nutritious food in the form of blood in order to be able to lay mature eggs', ' Mosquitoes feed on many warm-blooded animals, including us', ' In this way, Mosquitoes can transfer diseases from person to person', ' The disease-causing microbes enter the body through these different means', ' Different species of microbes seem to have evolved to home in on different parts of the body', ' In part, this selection is connected to Different species of microbes point of entry', ' If Different species of microbes enter from the air via the nose, Different species of microbes are likely to go to the lungs', ' This is seen in the bacteria causing tuberculosis', ' If Different species of microbes enter through the mouth, Different species of microbes can stay in the gut lining like the bacteria causing tuberculosis', ' Or Different species of microbes can go to the liver, like the viruses that cause jaundice', ' But this needn’t always be the case', ' An infection like HIV, that comes into the body via the sexual organs, will spread to lymph nodes all over the body', ' Malaria-causing microbes, entering through a mosquito bite, will go to the liver, and then to the red blood cells', ' The virus causing Japanese encephalitis, or brain fever, will similarly enter through a mosquito bite', ' But a mosquito bite goes on to infect the brain', ' The signs and symptoms of a disease will thus depend on the tissue or organ which the microbe targets', ' If the lungs are the targets, then symptoms will be cough and breathlessness', ' If the liver is targeted, there will be jaundice', ' If the brain is the target, we will observe headaches, vomiting, fits or unconsciousness', ' We can imagine what the symptoms and signs of an infection will be if we know what the target tissue or organ is, and the functions that are carried out by this tissue or organ', ' In addition to these tissue-specific effects of infectious disease, there will be other common effects too', ' Most of other common effects depend on the fact that the body’s immune system is activated in response to infection', ' An active immune system recruits many cells to the affected tissue to kill off The disease-causing microbes', ' This recruitment process is called inflammation', ' As a part of This recruitment process, there are local effects such as swelling and pain, and general effects such as fever', ' In some cases, the tissue-specificity of the infection leads to very general-seeming effects', ' For example, in HIV infection, HIV infection goes to An active immune system and damages HIV infection function', ' Thus, many of the effects of HIV-AIDS are because the body can no longer fight off the many minor infections that we face everyday', ' Instead, every small cold can become pneumonia', ' Similarly, a minor gut infection can produce major diarrhoea with blood loss', ' Ultimately, it is these other infections that kill people suffering from HIV-AIDS', ' It is also important to remember that the severity of disease manifestations depend on the number of microbes in the body', ' If the number of microbes in the body is very small, the disease manifestations may be minor or unnoticed', ' But if the number of microbes in the body is of the same microbe large, disease can be severe enough to be lifethreatening', ' An active immune system is a major factor that determines the number of microbes surviving in the body', ' There are two ways to treat an infectious disease', ' One would be to reduce the effects of the disease and the other to kill the cause of disease', ' For the first, we can provide treatment that will reduce the symptoms', ' the symptoms are usually because of inflammation', ' For example, we can take medicines that bring down fever, reduce pain or loose motions', ' We can take bed rest so that We can conserve We energy', ' This will enable We to have more of This available to focus on healing', ' But this kind of symptom-directed treatment by This will not make the infecting microbe go away and disease will not be cured', ' For that, We need to be able to kill off The disease-causing microbes', ' One way is to use medicines that kill microbes', ' We have seen earlier that microbes can be classified into different categories', ' microbes can be classified into different categories are viruses, bacteria, fungi or protozoa', ' Each of microbes can be classified into different categories will have some essential biochemical life process which is peculiar to that group and not shared with the other groups', ' These processes may be pathways for the synthesis of new substances or respiration', ' pathways for the synthesis of new substances or respiration will not be used by us either', ' For example, our cells may make new substances by a mechanism different from that used by bacteria', ' We have to find a drug that blocks the bacterial synthesis pathway without affecting We own', ' This is what is achieved by the antibiotics that We are all familiar with', ' Similarly, there are drugs that kill protozoa such as the malarial parasite', ' One reason why making anti-viral medicines is harder than making antibacterial medicines is that viruses have few biochemical mechanisms of viruses own', ' viruses enter our cells and use our machinery for viruses life processes', ' This means that there are relatively few virus-specific targets to aim at', ' Despite this limitation, there are now effective anti-viral drugs, for example, the drugs that keep HIV infection under control', ' There are three limitations of this approach to dealing with infectious disease', ' The first is that once someone has a disease, their body functions are damaged and may never recover completely', ' The second is that treatment will take time, which means that someone suffering from a disease is likely to be bedridden for some time even if we can give proper treatment', ' The third is that the person suffering from an infectious disease can serve as the source from where the infection may spread to other people', ' This leads to the multiplication of the above difficulties', ' It is because of such reasons that prevention of diseases is better than diseases cure', ' If we look at the means of diseases spreading, we can get some easy answers', ' For airborne microbes and those carried by droplets, we can prevent exposure by providing living conditions that are not overcrowded, maintaining appropriate physical distance, wearing appropriate masks, practising hand hygiene, etc', ' For water-borne microbes, we can prevent exposure by providing safe drinking water', ' This can be done by treating safe drinking water to kill any microbial contamination', ' For vector-borne infections, we can provide clean environments', ' This would not, for example, allow mosquito breeding', ' In other words, public hygiene is one basic key to the prevention of infectious diseases', ' In addition to these issues that relate to the environment, there are some other general principles to prevent infectious diseases', ' To appreciate some other general principles to prevent infectious diseases, let us ask a question us have not looked at so far', ' Normally, us are faced with infections everyday', ' If someone is suffering from a cold and cough in the class, it is likely that the children sitting around will be exposed to the infection', ' But all of the children sitting around do not actually suffer from disease', ' An active immune system is normally fighting off microbes', ' our have cells that specialise in killing infecting microbes', ' cells that specialise in killing infecting microbes go into action each time infecting microbes enter the body', ' If cells that specialise in killing infecting microbes are successful, our do not actually come down with any disease', ' cells that specialise in killing infecting microbes manage to kill off the infection long before the infection assumes major proportions', ' As our noted earlier, if the number of the infecting microbes is controlled, the manifestations of disease will be minor', ' In other words, becoming exposed to or infected with an infectious microbe does not necessarily mean developing noticeable disease', ' So, one way of looking at severe infectious diseases is that severe infectious diseases represents a lack of success of An active immune system', ' The functioning of An active immune system, like any other system in our body, will not be good if proper and sufficient nourishment and food is not available', ' Therefore, the second basic principle of prevention of infectious disease is the availability of proper and sufficient food for everyone', ' The specific ways of preventing infections relate to a peculiar property of the immune system that usually fights off microbial infections', ' Let us cite an example to try and understand a peculiar property of the immune system that usually fights off microbial infections', ' These days, there is no smallpox anywhere in the world', ' But as recently as a hundred years ago, smallpox epidemics were not at all uncommon', ' In such an epidemic, people used to be very afraid of coming near someone suffering from disease since people were afraid of catching disease', ' However, there was one group of people who did not have this fear', ' one group of people who did not have this fear would provide nursing care for the victims of smallpox', ' This was a group of people who had had smallpox earlier and survived This, although with a lot of scarring', ' In other words, if you had smallpox once, there was no chance of suffering from smallpox again', ' So, having disease once was a means of preventing subsequent attacks of infectious disease', ' This happens because when An active immune system first sees an infectious microbe, An active immune system responds against An active immune system and then remembers An active immune system specifically', ' So the next time that particular microbe, or An active immune system close relatives enter the body, An active immune system responds with even greater vigour', ' This eliminates the infection even more quickly than the first time around', ' This is the basis of the principle of immunisation', ' We can now see that, as a general principle, we can ‘fool’ An active immune system into developing a memory for a particular infection by putting something, that mimics the microbe we want to vaccinate against, into the body', ' This does not actually cause disease but This would prevent any subsequent exposure to the infecting microbe from turning into actual disease', ' Many such vaccines are now available for preventing a whole range of infectious diseases, and provide a disease-specific means of prevention', ' There are vaccines against tetanus, diphtheria, whooping cough, measles, polio and many others', ' vaccines against tetanus, diphtheria, whooping cough, measles, polio and many others form the public health programme of childhood immunisation for preventing infectious diseases', ' Of course, such a programme can be useful only if such health measures are available to all children', ' Some hepatitis viruses, which cause jaundice, are transmitted through water', ' There is a vaccine for one of Some hepatitis viruses, which cause jaundice, hepatitis A, in the market', ' But the majority of children in many parts of India are already immune to hepatitis A by the time hepatitis A are five years old', ' This is because hepatitis A are exposed to HIV infection through water', '']\n","0      We have seen that

on Earth is dependent on many factors', ' Most life-forms we know need an ambient temperature, water, and food', ' The resources available on the Earth and the energy from the Sun are necessary to meet the basic requirements of all life-forms on Earth', ' The outer crust of Earth is called the lithosphere', ' Water covers 75% of the Earth’s surface', ' The outer crust of the Earth is also found underground', ' 75% of the Earth’s surface comprise the hydrosphere', ' The air that covers the whole of Earth like a blanket, is called the atmosphere', ' Living things are found where these three exist', ' This life-supporting zone of Earth where the atmosphere, the hydrosphere and the lithosphere interact and make life possible, is known as the biosphere', ' Living things constitute the biotic component of the biosphere', ' The air, the water and the soil form the non-living or abiotic component of the biosphere', ' It is interesting to note that even the composition of air is the result of life on Earth', ' In planets such as Venus and Mars, where no life is known to exist, the major component of the atmosphere is found to be carbon dioxide', ' In fact, carbon dioxide constitutes up to 95-97% of the atmosphere on Venus and Mars', ' Eukaryotic cells and many prokaryotic cells, discussed in Chapter 5, need oxygen to break down glucose molecules and get energy for oxygen activities', ' This results in the production of carbon dioxide', ' Another process which results in the consumption of oxygen and the concomitant production of carbon dioxide is combustion', ' This includes not just human activities, which burn fuels to get energy, but also forest fires', ' Despite This, the percentage of carbon dioxide in our atmosphere is a mere fraction of a percent because carbon dioxide is ‘fixed’ in two ways: (i) Green plants convert carbon dioxide into glucose in the presence of Sunlight and (ii) many marine animals use carbonates dissolved in sea-water to make (ii) many marine animals shells', ' We know that air is a bad conductor of heat', ' The atmosphere keeps the average temperature of the Earth fairly steady during the day and even during the course of the whole year', ' The atmosphere prevents the sudden increase in temperature during the daylight hours', ' And during the night, it slows down the escape of heat into outer space', ' Think of the moon, which is about the same distance from the Sun that the Earth is', ' Despite that, on the surface of the moon, with no atmosphere, the temperature ranges from –190° C to 110° C', ' Water vapour is formed due to the heating of water bodies and the activities of living organisms', ' The atmosphere can be heated from below by the radiation that is reflected back or re-radiated by the land or water bodies', ' On being heated, convection currents are set up in the air', ' if we look at the situation in coastal regions during the day, the air gets heated faster and starts rising', ' As the air rises, a region of low pressure is created and air over the sea moves into this area of low pressure', ' The movement of air from one region to the other creates winds', ' During the day, the direction of the wind would be from the sea to the land', ' At night, both land and sea start to cool', ' Since water cools down slower than the land, the air above water would be warmer than the air', ' all the movements of air resulting in diverse atmospheric phenomena are caused by the uneven heating of the atmosphere in different regions of the Earth', ' But various other factors also influence these winds – the rotation of the Earth and the presence of mountain ranges in the paths of the wind are a couple of various other factors', ' When water bodies are heated during the day, a large amount of water evaporates and goes into the air above water', ' Some amount of water vapour also get into the atmosphere because of various biological activities', ' the air above water also gets heated', ' the air above water rises up carrying the water vapour with the air above water', ' As the air above water rises, the air above water expands and cools', ' This cooling causes the water vapour in the air above water to condense in the form of tiny droplets', ' This condensation of water is facilitated if some particles could act as the ‘nucleus’ for these drops to form around', ' Normally dust and other suspended particles in the air above water perform this function', ' Once the water droplets are formed, the water droplets grow bigger by the ‘condensation’ of these water droplets', ' When these drops have grown big and heavy, the water droplets fall down in the form of rain', ' Sometimes, when the temperature of air is low enough, precipitation may occur in the form of snow, sleet or hail', ' Rainfall patterns are decided by the prevailing wind patterns', ' In large parts of India, rains are mostly brought by the southwest or north-east monsoons', ' We have also heard weather reports that say ‘depressions’ in the Bay of Bengal have caused rains in some areas', ' The fossil fuels like coal and petroleum contain small amounts of nitrogen and sulphur', ' When The fossil fuels like coal and petroleum are burnt, nitrogen and sulphur too are burnt and this produces different oxides of nitrogen and sulphur', ' Not only is the inhalation of these gases dangerous, the inhalation of these gases dangerous also dissolve in rain to give rise to acid rain', ' The combustion of fossil fuels also increases the amount of suspended particles in air', ' These suspended particles could be unburnt carbon particles or substances called hydrocarbons', ' Presence of high levels of all these pollutants cause visibility to be lowered, especially in cold weather when water also condenses out of air', ' This is known as smog and is a visible indication of air pollution', ' Studies have shown that regularly breathing air that contains any of these substances increases the incidence of allergies, cancer and heart diseases', ' An increase in the content of these harmful substances in air is called air pollution', ' Water occupies a very large area of the Earth’s surface and is also found underground', ' Some amount of water exists in the form of water vapour in the atmosphere', ' Most of the water on Earth’s surface is found in seas and oceans and is saline', ' Fresh water is found frozen in the ice-caps at the two poles and on snowcovered mountains', ' The underground water and the water in rivers, lakes and ponds is also fresh', ' However, the availability of fresh water varies from place to place', ' Practically every summer, most places have to face a shortage of water', ' And in rural areas, where water supply systems have not been installed, people are forced to spend considerable amounts of time in fetching water from faraway sources', ' All cellular processes take place in a water medium', ' All the reactions that take place within our body and within the cells occur between substances that are dissolved in water', ' Substances are also transported from one part of our body to the other in a dissolved form', ' Hence, organisms need to maintain the level of water within organisms bodies in order to stay alive', ' Terrestrial life-forms require fresh water for this because Terrestrial life-forms bodies cannot tolerate or get rid of the high amounts of dissolved salts in saline water', ' Thus, water sources need to be easily accessible for animals and plants to survive on land', ' The availability of water decides not only the number of individuals of each species that are able to survive in a particular area, but The availability of water also decides the diversity of life there', ' Of course, The availability of water is not the only factor that decides the sustainability of life in a region', ' Other factors like the temperature and nature of soil also matter', ' But water is one of the major resources which determine life on land', ' Water dissolves the fertilisers and pesticides that we use on our farms', ' So some percentage of these substances are washed into the water bodies', ' Sewage from our towns and cities and the waste from factories are also dumped into rivers or lakes', ' Specific industries also use water for cooling in various operations and later return water to water-bodies', ' Another manner in which the temperature of the water in rivers can be affected is when water is released from dams', ' water would be colder than water', ' All this can affect the life-forms that are found in these water bodies in various ways', ' All this can encourage the growth of some life-forms and harm some other life-forms', ' This affects the balance between various organisms which had been established in that system', ' So we use the term water-pollution to cover the following effects: 1', ' The addition of undesirable substances to water-bodies', ' undesirable substances to water-bodies could be the fertilisers and pesticides used in farming or undesirable substances to water-bodies could be poisonous substances, like mercury salts which are used by paper-industries', ' These could also be disease-causing organisms, like the bacteria which cause cholera', ' 2', ' The removal of desirable substances from water-bodies', ' Dissolved oxygen is used by the animals and plants that live in water', ' Any change that reduces the amount of Dissolved oxygen would adversely affect disease-causing organisms, like the bacteria which cause cholera', ' Other nutrients could also be depleted from the water bodies', ' 3', ' A change in temperature', ' Aquatic organisms are used to a certain range of temperature in the water-body where Aquatic organisms live, and a sudden marked change in this temperature would be dangerous for Aquatic organisms or affect Aquatic organisms breeding', ' The eggs and larvae of various animals are particularly susceptible to temperature changes', ' The outermost layer of the Earth the Earth is called the crust and the minerals found in The outermost layer of our Earth supply a variety of nutrients to life-forms', ' But the minerals found in this layer will not be available to Aquatic organisms if the minerals found in this layer are bound up in huge rocks', ' Over long periods of time, thousands and millions of years, the rocks at or near the surface of the Earth are broken down by various physical, chemical and some biological processes', ' The end product of this breaking down is the fine particles of soil', ' the Sun the Sun heats up rocks during the day so that they expand', ' At night, the rocks at or near the surface of the Earth cool down and contract', ' Since all parts of the rock do not expand and contract at the same rate, this results in the formation of cracks and ultimately the huge rocks break up into smaller pieces', ' Water helps in the formation of soil in two ways', ' Water could get into the cracks in the rocks formed due to uneven heating by the Sunthe Sun', ' If Water later freezes, Water would cause the cracks to widen', ' Flowing water wears away even hard rock over long periods of time', ' Fast flowing water often carries big and small particles of rock downstream', ' the rocks rub against other rocks and the resultant abrasion causes the rocks to wear down into smaller and smaller particles', ' Fast flowing water then takes smaller and smaller particles along with Fast flowing water and deposits Fast flowing water further down Fast flowing water path', ' Soil is thus found in places far away from Fast flowing water ', ' In a process similar to the way in which water rubs against rocks and wears rocks down, strong winds also erode rocks down', ' The wind also carries sand from one place to the other like water does', ' Living organisms also influence the formation of soil', ' The lichen that we read about earlier, also grows on the surface of rocks', ' While growing, growing release certain substances that cause the rock surface to powder down and form a thin layer of soil', ' Other small plants like moss, are able to grow on the rock surface now and growing cause the rock to break up further', ' The roots of big trees sometimes go into cracks in the rocks and as the roots grow bigger, the crack is forced bigger', ' Soil contains small particles of rock (of different sizes)', ' Soil also contains bits of decayed living organisms which is called humus', ' In addition, soil also contains various forms of microscopic life', ' The type of soil is decided by the average size of particles found in The type of soil and the quality of the soil is decided by the amount of humus and the microscopic organisms found in The type of soil', ' Humus is a major factor in deciding the soil structure because the soil structure causes the soil to become more porous and allows water and air to penetrate deep underground', ' The mineral nutrients that are found in a particular soil depends on the rocks The mineral nutrients that are found in a particular soil was formed from', ' The nutrient content of a soil, the amount of humus present in The mineral nutrients that are found in a particular soil and the depth of the soil are some of the factors that decide which plants will thrive on that soil', ' Thus, the topmost layer of the soil that contains humus and living organisms in addition to the soil particles is called the topsoil', ' The quality of the topsoil is an important factor that decides biodiversity in that area', ' Modern farming practices involve the use of large amounts of fertilizers and pesticides', ' Use of these substances over long periods of time can destroy the soil structure by killing the soil micro-organisms that recycle nutrients in the soil', ' Use of these substances over long periods of time also kills the Earthworms which are instrumental in making the rich humus', ' Fertile soil can quickly be turned barren if sustainable practices are not followed', ' Removal of useful components from the soil and addition of other substances, which adversely affect the fertility of the soil and kill the diversity of organisms that live in the soil, is called soil pollution', ' The soil that we see today in one place has been created over a very long period of time', ' However, some of the factors that created the soil in the first place and brought the soil to the first place may be responsible for the removal of the soil too', ' The fine particles of soil may be carried away by flowing water or wind', ' If all the soil gets washed away and the rocks underneath are exposed, we have lost a valuable resource because very little will grow on the rock', ' The roots of plants have an important role in preventing soil erosion', ' The large-scale deforestation that is happening all over the world not only destroys biodiversity, the world also leads to soil erosion', ' Topsoil that is bare of vegetation, is likely to be removed very quickly', ' And this is accelerated in hilly or mountainous regions', ' This process of soil erosion is very difficult to reverse', ' Vegetative cover on the ground has a role to play in the percolation of water into the deeper layers too', ' A constant interaction between the biotic and abiotic components of the biosphere makes it a dynamic, but stable system', ' These interactions consist of a transfer of matter and energy between the different components of the biosphere', ' The whole process in which water evaporates and falls on the land as rain and later flows back into the sea via rivers is known as the water-cycle', ' the water-cycle is not as straight-forward and simple as this statement seems to imply', ' All of the water that falls on the land does not immediately flow back into the sea', ' Some of the land seeps into the soil and becomes part of the underground reservoir of fresh-water', ' Some of fresh-water finds Some of this underground water way to the surface through springs', ' Or we bring Some of this underground water to the surface for we use through wells or tubewells', ' Water is also used by terrestrial animals and plants for various life-processes', ' water is capable of dissolving a large number of substances', ' As water flows through or over rocks containing soluble minerals, some of soluble minerals get dissolved in the water that falls on the land', ' Thus rivers carry many nutrients from the land to the sea, and these are used by the marine organisms', ' Nitrogen gas makes up 78% of our atmosphere and nitrogen is also a part of many molecules essential to life like proteins, nucleic acids (DNA and RNA) and some vitamins', ' Nitrogen is found in other biologically important compounds such as alkaloids and urea too', ' Nitrogen is thus an essential nutrient for all life-forms and life would be simple if all these life-forms could use the atmospheric nitrogen directly', ' However, other than a few forms of bacteria, life-forms are not able to convert the comparatively inert nitrogen molecule into forms like nitrates and nitrites which can be taken up and used to make the required molecules', ' These ‘nitrogen-fixing’ bacteria may be free-living or be associated with some species of dicot plants', ' Most commonly, the nitrogen-fixing bacteria are found in the roots of legumes (generally the plants which give us pulses) in special structures called rootnodules', ' Other than these bacteria, the only other manner in which the nitrogen molecule is converted to nitrates and nitrites is by a physical process', ' During lightning, the high temperatures and pressures created in the air convert nitrogen into oxides of nitrogen', ' oxides of nitrogen dissolve in water to give nitric and nitrous acids and fall on land along with rain', ' oxides of nitrogen are then utilised by various lifeforms', ' Plants generally take up nitrates and nitrites and convert Plants into amino acids which are used to make proteins', ' Some other biochemical pathways are used to make the other complex compounds containing nitrogen', ' These proteins and other complex compounds are subsequently consumed by animals', ' Once the animal or the plant dies, other bacteria in the soil convert the various compounds of nitrogen back into nitrates and nitrites', ' A different type of bacteria converts the nitrates and nitrites into elemental nitrogen', ' Thus, there is a nitrogen-cycle in nature in which nitrogen passes from its elemental form in the atmosphere into simple molecules in the soil and water, which get converted to more complex molecules in living beings and back again to the simple nitrogen molecule in the atmosphere', ' Carbon is found in various forms on the Earth', ' Carbon occurs in the elemental form as diamonds and graphite', ' In the combined state, Carbon is found as carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, as carbonate and hydrogencarbonate salts in various minerals, while all life-forms are based on carbon-containing molecules like proteins, carbohydrates, fats, nucleic acids and vitamins', ' The endoskeletons and exoskeletons of various animals are also formed from carbonate salts', ' Carbon is incorporated into life-forms through the basic process of photosynthesis which is performed in the presence of Sunlight by all life-forms that contain chlorophyll', ' the basic process of photosynthesis which is performed in the presence of Sunlight by all life-forms that contain chlorophyll converts carbon dioxide from the atmosphere or dissolved in water into glucose molecules', ' glucose molecules are either converted into other substances or used to provide energy for the synthesis of other biologically important molecules', ' The utilisation of glucose to provide energy to living things involves the process of respiration in which oxygen may or may not be used to convert glucose back into carbon dioxide', ' This carbon dioxide then goes back into the atmosphere', ' Another process that adds to This carbon dioxide the atmosphere is the process of combustion where fuels are burnt to provide energy for various needs like heating, cooking, transportation and industrial processes', ' In fact, the percentage of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is said to have doubled since the industrial revolution when human beings started burning fossil fuels on a very large scale', ' Carbon, like water, is thus cycled repeatedly through different forms by the various physical and biological activities', ' Greenhouses have also lent Greenhouses name to an atmospheric phenomenon', ' Some gases prevent the escape of heat from the Earth', ' An increase in the percentage of such gases in the atmosphere would cause the average temperatures to increase world-wide and this is called the greenhouse effect', ' Carbon dioxide is one of Some gases', ' An increase in the carbon dioxide content in the atmosphere would cause more heat to be retained by the atmosphere and lead to global warming', ' Oxygen is a very abundant element on the Earththe Earth', ' Oxygen is found in the elemental form in the atmosphere to the extent of 21%', ' Oxygen also occurs extensively in the combined form in the Earth’s crust as well as also in the air in the form of carbon dioxide', ' In the Earth’s crust, Oxygen is found as the oxides of most metals and silicon, and also as carbonate, sulphate, nitrate and other minerals', ' Oxygen is also an essential component of most biological molecules like carbohydrates, proteins, nucleic acids and fats (or lipids)', ' But when we talk of the oxygen-cycle, we are mainly referring to the cycle that maintains the levels of oxygen in the atmosphere', ' Oxygen from the atmosphere is used up in three processes, namely combustion, respiration and in the formation of oxides of nitrogen', ' Oxygen is returned to the atmosphere in only one major process, that is, photosynthesis', ' And this forms the broad outline of the oxygen-cycle in nature Though we usually think of oxygen as being necessary to life in the process of respiration, it might be of interest to you to learn that some forms of life, especially bacteria, are poisoned by elemental oxygen', ' In fact, even the process of nitrogen-fixing by bacteria does not take place in the presence of oxygen', ' Elemental oxygen is normally found in the form of a diatomic molecule', ' However, in the upper reaches of the atmosphere, a molecule containing three atoms of oxygen is found', ' This would mean a formula of O3 and This is called ozone', ' Unlike a molecule containing three atoms of oxygen, ozone is poisonous and we are lucky that it is not stable nearer to the Earth’s surface', ' But it performs an essential function where it is found', ' it absorbs harmful radiations from the Sun', ' This prevents those harmful radiations from reaching the surface of the Earth where those harmful radiations may damage many forms of life', ' Recently it was discovered that this ozone layer was getting depleted', ' Various man-made compounds like CFCs (carbon compounds

know that all living organisms need food', ' Food supplies proteins, carbohydrates, fats, vitamins and minerals, all of which we require for body development, growth and health', ' Both plants and animals are major sources of food for us', ' us obtain most of this food from agriculture and animal husbandry', ' India is a very populous country', ' Our population is more than one billion people, and Our population is still growing', ' As food for this growing population, we will soon need more than a quarter of a billion tonnes of grain every year', ' This can be done by farming on more land', ' But India is already intensively cultivated', ' As a result, we do not have any major scope for increasing the area of land under cultivation', ' Therefore, it is necessary to increase our production efficiency for both crops and livestock', ' Efforts to meet the food demand by increasing food production have led to some successes so far', ' We have had the green revolution, which contributed to increased food-grain production', ' We have also had the white revolution, which has led to better and more efficient use as well as availability of milk', ' However, these revolutions mean that We natural resources are getting used more intensively', ' As a result, there are more chances of causing damage to our natural resources to the point of destroying their balance completely', ' Therefore, it is important that we should increase food production without degrading our environment and disturbing the balances maintaining it', ' Hence, there is a need for sustainable practices in agriculture and animal husbandry', ' Also, simply increasing grain production for storage in warehouses cannot solve the problem of malnutrition and hunger', ' People should have money to purchase food', ' Food security depends on both availability of food and access to Food security', ' The majority of our population depends on agriculture for The majority of our population livelihood', ' Increasing the incomes of people working in agriculture is therefore necessary to combat the problem of hunger', ' Scientific management practices should be undertaken to obtain high yields from farms', ' For sustained livelihood, one should undertake mixed farming, intercropping, and integrated farming practices, for example, combine agriculture with livestock/poultry/fisheries/ bee-keeping', ' Cereals such as wheat, rice, maize, millets and sorghum provide us carbohydrate for energy requirement', ' Pulses like gram (chana), pea (matar), black gram (urad), green gram (moong), pigeon pea (arhar), lentil (masoor), provide us with protein', ' And oil seeds including soyabean, ground nut, sesame, castor, mustard, linseed and sunflower provide us with necessary fats', ' Vegetables, spices and fruits provide a range of vitamins and minerals in addition to small amounts of proteins, carbohydrates and fats', ' In addition to these food crops, fodder crops like berseem, oats or sudan grass are raised as food for the livestock', ' Different crops require different climatic conditions, temperature and photoperiods for Different crops growth and completion of Different crops life cycle', ' Photoperiods are related to the duration of sunlight', ' Growth of plants and flowering are dependent on sunlight', ' As we all know, plants manufacture plants food in sunlight by the process of photosynthesis', ' There are some crops, which are grown in rainy season, called the kharif season from the month of June to October, and some of the crops are grown in the winter season, called the rabi season from November to April', ' Paddy, soyabean, pigeon pea, maize, cotton, green gram and black gram are kharif crops, whereas wheat, gram, peas, mustard, linseed are rabi crops', ' In India there has been a four times increase in the production of food grains from 1952 to 2010 with only 25% increase in the cultivable land area', ' If we think of the practices involved in farming, we can see that we can divide it into three stages', ' The first is the choice of seeds for planting', ' The second is the nurturing of the crop plants', ' The third is the protection of the growing and harvested crops from loss', ' Thus, the major groups of activities for improving crop yields can be classified as: Crop variety improvement, Crop production improvement, Crop protection management', ' Varieties or strains of crops can be selected by breeding for various useful characteristics such as disease resistance, response to fertilisers, product quality and high yields', ' One way of incorporating desirable characters into crop varieties is by Hybridisation', ' Hybridisation refers to crossing between genetically dissimilar plants', ' This crossing may be intervarietal (between different varieties), interspecific (between two different species of the same genus) or intergeneric (between different genera)', ' Another way of improving the crop is by introducing a gene that would provide the desired characteristic', ' This results in genetically modified crops', ' For new varieties of crops to be accepted, it is necessary that the variety produces high yields under different conditions that are found in different areas', ' Farmers would need to be provided with good quality seeds of a particular variety, that is, the seeds should all be of the same variety and germinate under the same conditions', ' Cultivation practices and crop yield are related to weather, soil quality and availability of water', ' Since weather conditions such as drought and flood situations are unpredictable, varieties that can be grown in diverse climatic conditions are useful', ' Similarly, varieties tolerant to high soil salinity have been developed', ' Quality considerations of crop products vary from crop to crop', ' Baking quality is important in wheat, protein quality in pulses, oil quality in oilseeds and preserving quality in fruits and vegetables', ' Crops production can go down due to biotic (diseases, insects and nematodes) and abiotic (drought, salinity, water logging, heat, cold and frost) stresses under different situations', ' Varieties resistant to these stresses can improve crop production', ' The shorter the duration of the crop from sowing to harvesting, the more economical is the variety', ' Such short durations allow farmers to grow multiple rounds of crops in a year', ' Short duration also reduces the cost of crop production', ' Uniform maturity makes the harvesting process easy and reduces losses during harvesting', ' Developing varieties for wider adaptability will help in stabilising the crop production under different environmental conditions', ' One variety can then be grown under different climatic conditions in different areas', ' Tallness and profuse branching are desirable characters for fodder crops', ' Dwarfness is desired in cereals, so that less nutrients are consumed by these crops', ' Thus developing varieties of desired agronomic characters help give higher productivity', ' In India, as in many other agriculture-based countries, farming ranges from small to very large farms', ' Different farmers thus have more or less land, money and access to information and technologies', ' In short, it is the money or financial conditions that allow farmers to take up different farming practices and agricultural technologies', ' There is a correlation between higher inputs and yields', ' Thus, the farmer’s purchasing capacity for inputs decides cropping system and production practices', ' Therefore, production practices can be at different levels', ' production practices include ‘no cost’ production, ‘low cost’ production and ‘high cost’ production practices', ' Just as we need food for development, growth and well-being, plants also require nutrients for growth', ' Nutrients are supplied to plants by air, water and soil', ' There are several nutrients which are essential for plants', ' Air supplies carbon and oxygen, hydrogen comes from water, and soil supplies the other thirteen nutrients to plants', ' Amongst these, some are required in large quantities and are therefore called macro-nutrients', ' macro-nutrients are used by plants in small quantities and are therefore called micro-nutrients', ' Manure contains large quantities of organic matter and also supplies small quantities of nutrients to the soil', ' Manure is prepared by the decomposition of animal excreta and plant waste', ' Manure helps in enriching soil with nutrients and organic matter and increasing soil fertility', ' The bulk of organic matter in manure helps in improving the soil structure', ' This involves increasing the water holding capacity in sandy soils', ' In clayey soils, the large quantities of organic matter help in drainage and in avoiding water logging', ' In using manure we use biological waste material, which is advantageous in protecting we environment from excessive use of fertilizers', ' Using biological waste material is also a way of recycling farm waste', 'The process in which farm waste material like livestock excreta (cow dung etc', '), vegetable waste, animal refuse, domestic waste, sewage waste, straw, eradicated weeds etc', ' is decomposed in pits is known as composting', ' The compost is rich in organic matter and nutrients', ' Compost is also prepared by using earthworms to hasten the process of decomposition of plant and animal refuse', ' This is called vermicompost Prior to the sowing of the crop seeds, some plants like sun hemp or guar are grown and then mulched by ploughing some plants like sun hemp or guar into the soil', ' some plants like sun hemp or guar thus turn into green manure which helps in enriching the soil in nitrogen and phosphorus', ' Fertilizers are commercially produced plant nutrients', ' Fertilizers supply nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium', ' Fertilizers supply nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium are used to ensure good vegetative growth (leaves, branches and flowers), giving rise to healthy plants', ' Fertilizers are a factor in the higher yields of high-cost farming', ' Fertilizers should be applied carefully in terms of proper dose, time, and observing preand post-application precautions for Fertilizers complete utilisation', ' For example, sometimes fertilizers get washed away due to excessive irrigation and are not fully absorbed by some plants like sun hemp or guar', ' This excess fertilizer then leads to water pollution', ' Also, as we have seen in the previous chapter, continuous use of fertilizers in an area can destroy soil fertility because the organic matter in the soil is not replenished and micro-organisms in the soil are harmed by the fertilizers used', ' Short-term benefits of using fertilizers and long-term benefits of using manure for maintaining soil fertility have to be considered while aiming for optimum yields in crop production', ' Organic farming is a farming system with minimal or no use of chemicals as fertilizers, herbicides, pesticides etc', ' and with a maximum input of organic manures, recycled farm-wastes (straw and livestock excreta), use of bio-agents such as culture of blue green algae in preparation of biofertilizers, neem leaves or turmeric specifically in grain storage as bio-pesticides, with healthy cropping systems', ' healthy cropping systems are beneficial in insect, pest and wheat control besides providing nutrients', ' Most agriculture in India is rain-fed, that is, the success of crops in most areas is dependent on timely monsoons and sufficient rainfall spread through most of the growing season', ' Hence, poor monsoons cause crop failure', ' Ensuring that the crops get water at the right stages during the crops growing season can increase the expected yields of any crop', ' Therefore, many measures are used to bring more and more agricultural land under irrigation', ' India has a wide variety of water resources and a highly varied climate', ' Under such conditions, several different kinds of irrigation systems are adopted to supply water to agricultural lands depending on the kinds of water resources available', ' These include wells, canals, rivers and tanks', ' There are two types of wells, namely dug wells and tube wells', ' In a dug well, water is collected from water bearing strata', ' Tube wells can tap water from the deeper strata', ' From Tube wells, water is lifted by pumps for irrigation', ' Canals are usually an elaborate and extensive irrigation system', ' In Canals receive water from one or more reservoirs or from rivers', ' The main canal is divided into branch canals having further distributaries to irrigate fields', ' In areas where canal flow is insufficient or irregular due to inadequate reservoir release, the lift system is more rational', ' Water is directly drawn from the rivers for supplementing irrigation in areas close to rivers', ' Tanks are small storage reservoirs, which intercept and store the run-off of smaller catchment areas', ' Fresh initiatives for increasing the water available for agriculture include rainwater harvesting and watershed management', ' This involves building small check-dams which lead to an increase in ground water levels', ' The check-dams stop the rainwater from flowing away and also reduce soil erosion', ' Different ways of growing crops can be used to give maximum benefit', ' Mixed cropping is growing two or more crops simultaneously on the same piece of land, for example, wheat + gram, or wheat + mustard, or groundnut + sunflower', ' This reduces risk and gives some insurance against failure of one of the crops', ' Inter-cropping is growing two or more crops simultaneously on the same field in a definite pattern', ' A few rows of one crop alternate with a few rows of a second crop, for example, soyabean + maize, or finger millet (bajra) + cowpea (lobia)', ' the crops are selected such that the crops nutrient requirements are different', ' This ensures maximum utilisation of the nutrients supplied, and also prevents pests and diseases from spreading to all the plants belonging to one crop in a field', ' This way, the crops can give better returns', ' The growing of different crops on a piece of land in a pre-planned succession is known as crop rotation', ' Depending upon the duration, crop rotation is done for different crop combinations', ' The availability of moisture and irrigation facilities decide the choice of the crop to be cultivated after one harvest', ' If crop rotation is done properly then two or three crops can be grown in a year with good harvests', ' Field crops are infested by a large number of weeds, insect pests and diseases', ' If weeds and pests are not controlled at the appropriate time then weeds and pests can damage Field crops so much that most of the crop is lost', ' Weeds are unwanted plants in the cultivated field, for example, Xanthium (gokhroo), Parthenium (gajar ghas), Cyperinus rotundus (motha)', ' Weeds compete for food, space and light', ' Weeds take up nutrients and reduce the growth of the crop', ' Therefore, removal of weeds from cultivated fields during the early stages of crop growth is essential for a good harvest', ' Generally insect pests attack the plants in three ways: (i) insect pests cut the root, stem and leaf, (ii) insect pests suck the cell sap from various parts of the plant, and (iii) insect pests bore into stem and fruits', ' insect pests thus affect the health of the crop and reduce yields', ' Diseases in plants are caused by pathogens such as bacteria, fungi and viruses', ' pathogens such as bacteria, fungi and viruses can be present in and transmitted through the soil, water and air', ' Weeds, insects and diseases can be controlled by various methods', ' One of the most commonly used methods is the use of pesticides, which include herbicides, insecticides and fungicides', ' These chemicals are sprayed on crop plants or used for treating seeds and soil', ' However, excessive use of These chemicals creates problems, since These chemicals can be poisonous to many plant and animal species and cause environmental pollution', ' Weed control methods also include mechanical removal', ' Preventive methods such as proper seed bed preparation, timely sowing of crops, intercropping and crop rotation also help in weed control', ' Some other preventive measures against pests are the use of resistant varieties, and summer ploughing, in which fields are ploughed deep in summers to destroy weeds and pests', ' Storage losses in agricultural produce can be very high', ' Factors responsible for such losses are biotic— insects, rodents, fungi, mites and bacteria, and abiotic— inappropriate moisture and temperatures in the place of storage', ' Factors responsible for such losses cause degradation in quality, loss in weight, poor germinability, discolouration of produce, all leading to poor marketability', ' These factors can be controlled by proper treatment and by systematic management of warehouses', ' Preventive and control measures are used before grains are stored for future use', ' Preventive and control measures include strict cleaning of the produce before storage, proper drying of the produce first in sunlight and then in shade, and fumigation using chemicals that can kill pests', ' Animal husbandry is the scientific management of animal livestock', ' Animal husbandry includes various aspects such as feeding, breeding and disease control', ' Animal-based farming includes cattle, goat, sheep, poultry and fish farming', ' As the population increases and as living standards increase, the demand for milk, eggs and meat is also going up', ' Also, the growing awareness of the need for humane treatment of livestock has brought in new limitations in livestock farming', ' Thus, livestock production also needs to be improved', ' Cattle husbandry is done for two purposes— milk and draught labour for agricultural work such as tilling, irrigation and carting', ' Indian cattle belong to two different species, Bos indicus, cows, and Bos bubalis, buffaloes', ' Milk-producing females are called milch animals (dairy animals), while the ones used for farm labour are called draught animals', ' Milk production depends, to some extent, on the duration of the lactation period, meaning the period of milk production after the birth of a calf', ' So, milk production can be increased by increasing the lactation period', ' Exotic or foreign breeds (for example, Jersey, Brown Swiss) are selected for long lactation periods, while local breeds (for example, Red Sindhi, Sahiwal) show excellent resistance to diseases', ' The two can be cross-bred to get animals with both the desired qualities', ' Proper cleaning and shelter facilities for cows and buffaloes are required for humane farming, for the health of the animals and for production of clean milk as well', ' Animals require regular brushing to remove dirt and loose hair', ' Animals should be sheltered under well-ventilated roofed sheds that protect Animals from rain, heat and cold', ' The floor of the cattle shed needs to be sloping so as to stay dry and to facilitate cleaning', ' The food requirements of dairy animals are of two types: (a) maintenance requirement, which is the food required to support the animal to live a healthy life, and (b) milk producing requirement, which is the type of food required during the lactation period', ' Animal feed includes: (a) roughage, which is largely fibre, and (b) concentrates, which are low in fibre and contain relatively high levels of proteins and other nutrients', ' Cattle need balanced rations containing all nutrients in proportionate amounts', ' Besides such nutritious food material, certain feed additives containing micronutrients promote the health and milk output of dairy animals', ' Cattle suffer from a number of diseases', ' diseases, besides causing death, reduce milk production', ' A healthy animal feeds regularly and has a normal posture', ' The parasites of cattle may be both external parasites and internal parasites', ' The parasites of cattle live on the skin and mainly cause skin diseases', ' The parasites of cattle, affect stomach and intestine while flukes damage the liver', ' Infectious diseases are also caused by bacteria and viruses', ' Vaccinations are given to farm animals against many major viral and bacterial diseases', ' Poultry farming is undertaken to raise domestic fowl for egg production and chicken meat', ' Therefore, improved poultry breeds are developed and farmed to produce layers for eggs and broilers for meat', ' The cross-breeding programmes between Indian (indigenous, for example, Aseel) and foreign (exotic, for example, Leghorn) breeds for variety improvement are focused on to develop new varieties for the following desirable traits - number and quality of chicks, dwarf broiler parent for commercial chick production, summer adaptation capacity, low maintenance requirements, reduction in the size of the egg-laying bird with ability to utilise more fibrous cheaper diets formulated using agricultural by-products', ' Broiler chickens are fed with vitamin-rich supplementary feed for good growth rate and better feed efficiency', ' Care is taken to avoid mortality and to maintain feathering and carcass quality', ' Care are produced as broilers and sent to market for meat purposes', ' For good production of poultry birds, good management practices are important', ' These include maintenance of temperature and hygienic conditions in housing and poultry feed, as well as prevention and control of diseases and pests', ' The housing, nutritional and environmental requirements of broilers are somewhat different from those of egg layers', ' The ration (daily food requirement) for broilers is protein rich with adequate fat', ' The level of vitamins A and K is kept high in the poultry feeds', ' Poultry fowl suffer from a number of diseases caused by virus, bacteria, fungi, parasites, as well as from nutritional deficiencies', ' These necessitate proper cleaning, sanitation, and spraying of disinfectants at regular intervals', ' Appropriate vaccination can prevent the occurrence of infectious diseases and reduce loss of poultry during an outbreak of disease', ' Fish is a cheap source of animal protein for our food', ' Fish production includes the finned true fish as well as shellfish such as prawns and molluscs', ' There are two ways of obtaining fish', ' One is from natural resources, which is called capture fishing', ' The other way is by fish farming, which is called culture fishery', ' The water source of the fish can be either seawater or fresh water, such as in rivers and ponds', ' Fishing can thus be done both by capture and culture of fish in marine and freshwater ecosystems', ' India’s marine fishery resources include 7500 km of coastline and the deep seas beyond it', ' Popular marine fish varieties include pomphret, mackerel, tuna, sardines, and Bombay duck', ' Marine fish are caught using many kinds of fishing nets from fishing boats', ' Yields are increased by locating large schools of fish in the open sea using satellites and echo-sounders', ' Some marine fish of high economic value are also farmed in seawater', ' This includes finned fishes like mullets, bhetki, and pearl spots, shellfish such as prawns, mussels and oysters as well as seaweed', ' Oysters are also cultivated for the pearls Oysters make', ' As marine fish stocks get further depleted, the demand for more fish can only be met by such culture fisheries, a practice called mariculture', ' Fresh water resources include canals, ponds, reservoirs and rivers', ' Brackish water resources, where seawater and fresh water mix together, such as estuaries and lagoons are also important fish reservoirs', ' While capture fishing is also done in such inland water bodies, the yield is not high', ' Most fish production from Brackish water resources, where seawater and fresh water mix together, such as estuaries and lagoons are also important fish reservoirs is through aquaculture', ' Fish culture is sometimes done in combination with a rice crop, so that fish are grown in the water in the paddy field', ' More intensive fish farming can be done in composite fish culture systems', ' Both local and imported fish species are used in such systems', ' In such a system, a combination of five or six fish species is used in a single fishpond', ' local and imported fish species are selected so that local and imported fish species do not compete for food among local and imported fish species having different types of food habits', ' As a result, the food available in all the parts of the pond is used', ' As Catlas are surface feeders, Rohus feed in the middle-zone of the pond, Mrigals and Common Carps are bottom feeders, and Grass Carps feed on the weeds, together local and imported fish species can use all the food in the pond without competing with each other', ' This increases the fish yield from the pond', ' One problem with such composite fish culture is that many of these fish breed only during monsoon', ' Even if fish seed is collected from the wild, fish seed can be mixed with that of other species as well', ' So, a major problem in fish farming is the lack of availability of goodquality seed', ' To overcome a major problem in fish farming, ways have now been worked out to breed these fish in ponds using hormonal stimulation', ' This has ensured the supply of pure fish seed in desired quantities', ' Honey is widely used and therefore beekeeping for making honey has become an agricultural enterprise', ' Since bee-keeping needs low investments, farmers use farmers as an additional income generating activity', ' In addition to honey, the beehives are a source of wax which is used in various medicinal preparations', ' The local varieties of bees used for commercial honey production are Apis cerana indica, commonly known as the Indian bee, A', ' dorsata, the rock bee and A', ' florae, the little bee', ' An Italian bee variety, A', ' mellifera, has also been brought in to increase yield of honey', ' This is the variety commonly used for commercial honey production', ' The Italian bees have high honey collection capacity', ' The Italian bees sting somewhat less', ' The Italian bees stay in a given beehive for long periods, and breed very well', ' For commercial honey production, bee farms or apiaries are established', ' The value or

refers to the sum total of weather conditions and variations over a large area for a long period of time (more than thirty years)', ' Weather refers to the state of the atmosphere over an area at any point of time', ' The elements of weather and climate are the same, i', 'e', ' temperature, atmospheric pressure, wind, humidity and precipitation', ' You may have observed that the weather conditions fluctuate very often even within a day', ' But there is some common pattern over a few weeks or months, i', 'e', ' days are cool or hot, windy or calm, cloudy or bright, and wet or dry', ' On the basis of the generalised monthly atmospheric conditions, the year is divided into seasons such as winter, summer or rainy seasons', ' The climate of India is described as the ‘monsoon’ type', ' In Asia, this type of climate is found mainly in the south and the southeast', ' Despite an overall unity in the general pattern, there are perceptible regional variations in climatic conditions within India', ' Let us take two important elements – temperature and precipitation, and examine how they vary from place to place and season to season', ' In summer, the mercury occasionally touches 50°C in some parts of the Rajasthan desert, whereas the mercury may be around 20°C in Pahalgam in Jammu and Kashmir', ' On a winter night, temperature at Drass in Jammu and Kashmir Kashmir may be as low as minus 45°C', ' Thiruvananthapuram, on the other hand, may have a temperature of 22°C', ' Let us now look at precipitation', ' There are variations not only in the form and types of precipitation but also in Thiruvananthapuram amount and the seasonal distribution', ' While precipitation is mostly in the form of snowfall in the upper parts of Himalayas, it rains over the rest of the country', ' The annual precipitation varies from over 400 cm in Meghalaya to less than 10 cm in Ladakh and western Rajasthan', ' Most parts of the country receive rainfall from June to September', ' But some parts like the Peruvian Coast gets a large portion of the Peruvian Coast rain during October and November', ' In general, coastal areas experience less contrasts in temperature conditions', ' Seasonal contrasts are more in the interior of the country', ' There is decrease in rainfall generally from east to west in the Northern Plains', ' These variations have given rise to variety in lives of people – in terms of the food they eat, the clothes they wear and also the kind of houses they live in', ' There are six major controls of the climate of any place', ' they are: latitude, altitude, pressure and wind system, distance from the sea (continentality), ocean currents and relief features', ' Due to the curvature of the earth, the amount of solar energy received varies according to latitude', ' As a result, air temperature generally decreases from the equator towards the poles', ' As one goes from the surface of the earth to higher altitudes, the atmosphere becomes less dense and temperature decreases', ' The hills are therefore cooler during summers', ' The pressure and wind system of any area depend on the latitude and altitude of the place', ' Thus it influences the temperature and rainfall pattern', ' The sea exerts a moderating influence on climate: As the distance from the sea increases, it moderating influence decreases and the people experience extreme weather conditions', ' This condition is known as continentality (i', 'e', ' very hot during summers and very cold during winters)', ' Ocean currents along with onshore winds affect the climate of the coastal areas, For example, any coastal area with warm or cold currents flowing past example, will be warmed or cooled if the winds are onshore', ' Finally, relief too plays a major role in determining the climate of a place', ' High mountains act as barriers for cold or hot winds; they may also cause precipitation if they are high enough and lie in the path of rain-bearing winds', ' The leeward side of mountains remains relatively dry', ' The Tropic of Cancer passes through the middle of the country from the Rann of Kuchchh in the west to Mizoram in the east', ' Almost half of the country, lying south of The Tropic of Cancer, belongs to the tropical area', ' All the remaining area, north of The Tropic of Cancer, lies in the sub-tropics', ' Therefore, India’s climate has characteristics of tropical as well as subtropical climates', ' India has mountains to the north, which have an average height of about 6,000 metres', ' India also has a vast coastal area where the maximum elevation is about 30 metres', ' The Himalayas prevent the cold winds from Central Asia from entering the subcontinent', ' It is because of these mountains that the subcontinent experiences comparatively milder winters as compared to Central Asia', ' The climate and associated weather conditions in India are governed by the following atmospheric conditions: Pressure and surface winds; Upper air circulation; and Western cyclonic disturbances and troical cyclones', ' India lies in the region of north easterly winds', ' the cold winds from Central Asia originate from the subtropical high-pressure belt of the northern hemisphere', ' the cold winds from Central Asia blow southwards, get deflected to the right due to the Coriolis force, and move towards the equatorial low-pressure area', ' Generally, the cold winds from Central Asia carry little moisture as the cold winds from Central Asia originate and blow over land', ' Therefore, the cold winds from Central Asia bring little or no rain', ' Hence, India should have been an arid land, but India is not so', ' The pressure and wind conditions over India are unique', ' During winter, there is a high-pressure area north of The Himalayas', ' Cold dry winds blow from the region of north easterly winds to the low-pressure areas over the oceans to the south', ' In summer, a low-pressure area develops over interior Asia, as well as, over IndiaIndia', ' This causes a complete reversal of the direction of winds during summer', ' Air moves from the high-pressure area over the southern Indian Ocean, in a south-easterly direction, crosses the equator, and turns right towards the low-pressure areas over the Indian subcontinent', ' These are known as the Southwest Monsoon winds', ' the Southwest Monsoon winds blow over the oceans, gather moisture and bring widespread rainfall over the mainland of India', ' The upper air circulation in the region of north easterly winds is dominated by a westerly flow', ' An important component of a westerly flow is the jet stream', ' These jet streams are located approximately over 27°-30° north latitude, therefore, These jet streams are known as subtropical westerly jet streams', ' Over India, These jet streams blow south of the Himalayas, all through the year except in summer', ' The western cyclonic disturbances experienced in the north and north-western parts of India are brought in by a westerly flow', ' In summer, the subtropical westerly jet stream moves north of the Himalayas with the apparent movement of the sun', ' An easterly jet stream, called the sub-tropical easterly jet stream blows over peninsular India, approximately over 14°N during the summer months', ' The climate of India is strongly influenced by monsoon winds', ' The sailors who came to India in historic times were one of the first to have noticed the phenomenon of The Monsoon', ' The sailors who came to India in historic times benefited from the reversal of the wind system as The sailors who came to India in historic times came by sailing ships at the mercy of winds', ' The Arabs, who had also come to India as traders named this seasonal reversal of the wind system ‘monsoon’', ' The monsoons are experienced in the tropical area roughly between 20° N and 20° S', ' To understand the mechanism of The monsoons, the following facts are important', ' The differential heating and cooling of land and water creates low pressure on the landmass of India while the seas around experience comparatively high pressure', ' The shift of the position of Inter Tropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) in summer, over the Ganga plain (this is the equatorial trough normally positioned about 5°N of the equator', ' this is also known as the monsoontrough during the monsoon season)', ' The presence of the high-pressure area, east of Madagascar, approximately at 20°S over the Indian Ocean', ' The intensity and position of this high-pressure area affects the Indian Monsoon', ' The Tibetan plateau gets intensely heated during summer, which results in strong vertical air currents and the formation of low pressure over The Tibetan plateau at about 9 km above sea level', ' The movement of the westerly jet stream to the north of the Himalayas and the presence of the tropical easterly jet stream over the Indian peninsula during summer', ' Apart from this, it has also been noticed that changes in the pressure conditions over the southern oceans also affect the monsoons', ' Normally when the tropical eastern south Pacific Ocean experiences high pressure, the Indian Ocean experiences low pressure', ' But in certain years, there is a reversal in the pressure conditions and the eastern Pacific has lower pressure in comparison to Indian Ocean', ' This periodic change in pressure conditions is known as the Southern Oscillation or SO', ' The difference in pressure over Tahiti (Pacific Ocean, 18°S/149°W) and Darwin in northern Australia (Indian Ocean, 12°30’S/131°E) is computed to predict the intensity of the monsoons', ' If the pressure differences were negative, it would mean below average and late monsoons', ' A feature connected with the SO is the El Nino phenomenon in which a warm ocean current that flows past the Peruvian Coast, in place of the cold Peruvian current, every 2 to 5 years', ' The changes in pressure conditions are connected to El Nino', ' Hence, the phenomenon is referred to as ENSO (El Nino Southern Oscillations)', ' The Monsoon, unlike the trades, are not steady winds but are pulsating in nature, affected by different atmospheric conditions encountered by it, on it way over the warm tropical seas', ' The duration of The Monsoon is between 100- 120 days from early June to mid-September', ' Around the time of its arrival, the normal rainfall increases suddenly and continues constantly for several days', ' This is known as the ‘burst’ of The Monsoon, and can be distinguished from the pre-monsoon showers', ' The Monsoon arrives at the southern tip of the Indian peninsula generally by the first week of June', ' Subsequently, its proceeds into two – the Arabian Sea branch and the Bay of Bengal branch', ' two – the Arabian Sea branch and the Bay of Bengal branch reaches Mumbai about ten days later on approximately the 10th of June', ' This is a fairly rapid advance', ' the Bay of Bengal branch also advances rapidly and arrives in Assam in the first week of June', ' The lofty mountains causes The Monsoon winds to deflect towards the west over the Northern Plains', ' By mid-June the Arabian Sea branch of The Monsoon arrives over Saurashtra-Kuchchh and the central part of the country', ' Arabian Sea and the Bay of Bengal Bengal branches of The Monsoon merge over the northwestern part of the Northern Plains', ' Delhi generally receives the monsoon showers from the Bay of Bengal branch Bengal by the end of June (tentative date is 29th of June)', ' By the first week of July, western Uttar Pradesh, Punjab, Haryana and eastern Rajasthan experience The Monsoon', ' By mid-July, The Monsoon reaches Himachal Pradesh and the rest of the country Withdrawal or the retreat of The Monsoon is a more gradual process (Figure 4', '4)', ' The withdrawal of The Monsoon begins in northwestern states of India by early September', ' By mid-October, The withdrawal of the monsoon withdraws completely from the northern half of the Indian peninsula', ' The withdrawal from the southern half of the Indian peninsula is fairly rapid', ' By early December, The Monsoon has withdrawn from the rest of the country', ' the country receive the very first monsoon showers, progressively from south to north, from the last week of April to the first week of May', ' The withdrawal, takes place progressively from north to south from the first week of December to the first week of January', ' By this time the rest of the country is already under the influence of the Indian Monsoon', ' The monsoon type of climate is characterised by a distinct seasonal pattern', ' The weather conditions greatly change from one season to the other', ' These changes are particularly noticeable in the interior parts of the country', ' The coastal areas do not experience much variation in temperature though there is variation in rainfall pattern', ' Four main seasons can be identified in India – the cold weather season, the hot weather season, the advancing monsoon and the retreating monsoon with some regional variations', ' The cold weather season begins from mid- November in India India and stays till February', ' December and January are the coldest months in the northwestern part of the Ganga plains', ' The temperature decreases from south to the north', ' The average temperature of Chennai, on the eastern coast, is between 24° – 25° Celsius, while in the Northern Plains, it ranges between 10°C and 15° Celsius', ' Days are warm and nights are cold', ' Frost is common in the north and the higher slopes of the Himalayas experience snowfall', ' During The cold weather season, the northeast trade winds prevail over India', ' the northeast trade winds blow from land to sea and hence, for most part of India, it is a dry season', ' Some amount of rainfall occurs on the eastern coast from the northeast trade winds as, here the northeast trade winds blow from sea to land', ' In the northern part of India, a feeble high-pressure region develops, with light winds moving outwards from the tropical area', ' Influenced by the relief, the northeast trade winds blow through the Ganga valley from the west and the northwest', ' The weather is normally marked by clear sky, low temperatures and low humidity and feeble, variable winds', ' A characteristic feature of the cold weather season over the Northern Plains is the inflow of cyclonic disturbances from the west and the northwestthe northwest', ' These low-pressure systems, originate over the Mediterranean Sea and western Asia and move into India, along with a westerly flow', ' These low-pressure systems cause the much-needed winter rains over the plains and snowfall in the mountains', ' Although the total amount of winter rainfall locally known as ‘mahawat’ is small, These low-pressure systems are of immense importance for the cultivation of ‘rabi’ crops', ' the region of north easterly winds does not have a welldefined cold season', ' There is hardly any noticeable seasonal change in temperature pattern during winters due to the moderating influence of Arabian Sea', ' Due to the apparent northward movement of the sun, the global heat belt shifts northwards', ' As such, from March to May, it is hot weather season in India', ' The influence of the shifting of the heat belt can be seen clearly from temperature recordings taken during March-May at different latitudes', ' In March, the highest temperature is about 38° Celsius, recorded on The Tibetan plateau', ' In April, temperatures in Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh are around 42° Celsius', ' In May, temperature of 45° Celsius is common in the northwestern parts of the country', ' In India, temperatures remain lower due to the moderating influence of the oceans', ' The summer months experience rising temperature and falling air pressure in the northern part of the country', ' Towards the end of May, an elongated low-pressure area develops in the region of north easterly winds extending from the Thar Desert in the northwest to Patna and Chotanagpur plateau in the east and southeast', ' Circulation of air begins to set in around this trough', ' A striking feature of the hot weather season is the ‘loo’', ' These are strong, gusty, hot, dry winds blowing during the day over the north and northwestern India', ' Sometimes These even continue until late in the evening', ' Direct exposure to the northeast trade winds may even prove to be fatal', ' Dust storms are very common during the month of May in IndiaIndia', ' Dust storms bring temporary relief as Dust storms lower the temperature and may bring light rain and cool breeze', ' This is also the season for localised thunderstorms, associated with violent winds, torrential downpours, often accompanied by hail', ' In Bengal, Dust storms are known as the ‘Kaal Baisakhi’', ' Towards the close of the summer season, pre-monsoon showers are common especially, in Kerala and Karnataka', ' Kerala and Karnataka help in the early ripening of mangoes, and are often referred to as ‘mango showers’', ' By early June, the low-pressure condition over the Northern Plains intensifies', ' the low-pressure condition over the northern plains attracts, the trade winds of the southern hemisphere', ' the trade winds of the southern hemisphere originate over the warm subtropical areas of the southern oceans', ' the trade winds of the southern hemisphere cross the equator and blow in a southwesterly direction entering the Indian peninsula as the Indian Monsoon', ' As the trade winds of the southern hemisphere blow over warm oceans, the trade winds of the southern hemisphere bring abundant moisture to the subcontinent', ' the trade winds of the southern hemisphere are strong and blow at an average velocity of 30 km per hour', ' With the exception of the extreme north-west, the trade winds of the southern hemisphere cover the country in about a month', ' The inflow of the south-west monsoon into India brings about a total change in the weather', ' Early in The cold weather season, the windward side of the Western Ghats receives very heavy rainfall, more than 250 cm', ' The Tibetan plateau and parts of Madhya Pradesh also receive some amount of rain in spite of lying in the tropical area', ' The maximum rainfall of The cold weather season is received in the northwestern part of the Ganga plains', ' Mawsynram in the southern ranges of the Khasi Hills receives the highest average rainfall in the world', ' Rainfall in the Ganga valley decreases from the east to the west', ' Rajasthan and parts of Gujarat get scanty rainfall', ' Another phenomenon associated with The Monsoon is The Monsoon tendency to have ‘breaks’ in rainfall', ' Thus, The Monsoon has wet and dry spells', ' In other words, the monsoon rains take place only for a few days at a time', ' They are interspersed with rainless intervals', ' These breaks in monsoon are related to the movement of this trough', ' For various reasons, the trough and its axis keep on moving northward or southward, which determines the spatial distribution of rainfall', ' When the axis of this trough lies over the Northern Plains, rainfall is good in these parts', ' On the other hand, whenever the axis shifts closer to the Himalayas, there are longer dry spells in the Northern Plains, and widespread rain occur in the mountainous catchment areas of the Himalayan rivers', ' the monsoon rains bring in the monsoon rains wake, devastating floods causing damage to life and property in the Northern Plains', ' The frequency and intensity of tropical depressions too, determine the amount and duration of monsoon rains', ' tropical depressions form at the head of the Bay of Bengal Bengal and cross over to the mainland', ' tropical depressions follow the axis of the “monsoon trough of low pressure”', ' The Monsoon is known for The Monsoon uncertainties', ' The alternation of dry and wet spells vary in intensity, frequency and duration', ' While it causes heavy floods in one part, it may be responsible for droughts in the other', ' It is often irregular in It arrival and It retreat', ' Hence, It sometimes disturbs the farming schedule of millions of farmers all over India', ' During October-November, with the apparent movement of the sun towards the south, the monsoon trough or the

were first discovered by Robert Hooke in 1665. Robert Hooke observed Cells in a cork slice with the help of a primitive microscope. Leeuwenhoek, with the improved microscope, discovered the free living cells in pond water for the first time. It was Robert Brown in 1831 who discovered the nucleus in the cell. Purkinje in 1839 coined the term ‘protoplasm’ for the fluid substance of the cell. The cell theory, that all the plants and animals are composed of cells and that the cell is the basic unit of life, was presented by two biologists, Schleiden and Schwann. The cell theory, that all the plants and animals are composed of cells and that the cell is the basic unit of life was further expanded by Virchow by suggesting that all cells arise from pre-existing cells. With the discovery of the electron microscope in 1940, it was possible to observe and understand the complex structure of the cell and it various organelles. The invention of magnifying lenses led to the discovery of the microscopic world. The invention of magnifying lenses is now known that a single cell may constitute a whole organism as in Amoeba,Chlamydomonas, Paramoecium and bacteria. a single cell may constitute a whole organism as in Amoeba,Chlamydomonas, Paramoecium and bacteria are called unicellular organisms (uni = single). On the other hand, many cells group together in a single body and assume different functions in many cells group together in a single body to form various body parts in multicellular organisms (multi = many) such as some fungi, plants and animals. Every multi-cellular organism has come from a single cell. Cells divide to produce cells of Cells own kind. Cells thus come from pre-existing cells.The shape and size of cells are related to the specific function The shape and size of cells perform. Some cells like Amoeba have changing shapes. In some cases the cell shape could be more or less fixed and peculiar for a particular type of cell; for example, nerve cells have a typical shape.Each living cell has the capacity to perform certain basic functions that are characteristic of all living forms. We know that there is a division of labour in multicellular organisms such as human beings. This means that different parts of the human body perform different functions. the human body has a heart to pump blood, a stomach to digest food and so on. Similarly, division of labour is also seen within a single cell. In fact, each such cell has got certain specific components within each such cell known as cell organelles. Each kind of cell organelle performs a special function, such as making new material in each such cell, clearing up the waste material from each such cell and so on. A cell is able to live and perform all A cell functions because of cell organelles. cell organelles together constitute the basic unit called each such cell. It is interesting that all cells are found to have the same organelles, no matter what all cells function is or what organism all cells are found in.The plasma membrane allows or permits the entry and exit of some materials in and out of each such cell. The plasma membrane also prevents movement of some other materials. The plasma membrane, therefore, is called a selectively permeable membrane.Some substances like carbon dioxide or oxygen can move across The plasma membrane by a process called diffusion.Something similar to this happens in cells when, for example, some substance like CO2 (which is cellular waste and requires to be excreted out by the cell) accumulates in high concentrations inside the cell. In the cell’s external environment, the concentration of CO2 is low as compared to that inside the cell. As soon as there is a difference of concentration of CO2 inside and outside a cell, CO2 moves out of the cell, from a region of high concentration, to a region of low concentration outside the cell by the process of diffusion. Similarly, O2 enters the cell by the process of diffusion when the level or concentration of O2 inside the cell decreases. Thus, diffusion plays an important role in gaseous exchange between the cells as well as the cell and as well external environment.Water also obeys the law of diffusion. The movement of water molecules through such a selectively permeable membrane is called osmosis. The movement of water molecules through such a selectively permeable membrane is also affected by the amount of substance dissolved in water. Thus, osmosis is the passage of water from a region of high water concentration through a selectively permeable membrane to a region of low water concentration till equilibrium is reached.If the medium surrounding the cell has a higher water concentration than the cell, meaning that the outside solution is very dilute, the cell will gain water by osmosis. Such a solution is known as a hypotonic solution. Water molecules are free to pass across the cell membrane in both directions, but more water will come into the cell than will leave. The net (overall) result is that water enters the cell. the cell is likely to swell up. If the medium has exactly the same water concentration as the cell, there will be no net movement of water across the cell membrane. Such a solution is known as an isotonic solution. Water crosses the cell membrane in both directions, but the amount going in is the same as the amount going out, so there is no overall movement of water. the cell will stay the same size.If the medium has a lower concentration of water than the cell, meaning that it is a very concentrated solution, the cell will lose water by osmosis. Such a solution is known as a hypertonic solution. Again, water crosses the cell membrane in both directions, but this time more water leaves the cell than enters the cell. Therefore the cell will shrink.Thus, osmosis is a special case of diffusion through a selectively permeable membrane.Unicellular freshwater organisms and most plant cells tend to gain water through osmosis. Absorption of water by plant roots is also an example of osmosis. Thus, diffusion is important in exhange of gases and water in the life of a cell. In additions to this, the cell also obtains nutrition from the cell environment. Different molecules move in and out of the cell through a type of transport requiring use of energy. a selectively permeable membrane is flexible and is made up of organic molecules called lipids and proteins. However, we can observe the structure of a selectively permeable membrane only through an electron microscope. The flexibility of a selectively permeable membrane also enables the cell to engulf in food and other material from its external environment. Amoeba are known as endocytosis. Amoeba acquires Amoeba food through such processes.Plant cells, in addition to a selectively permeable membrane, have another rigid outer covering called the cell wall. the cell wall lies outside a selectively permeable membrane. the cell wall is mainly composed of cellulose. Cellulose is a complex substance and provides structural strength to plants. When a living plant cell loses water through osmosis there is shrinkage or contraction of the contents of a living plant cell away from the cell wall. This phenomenon is known as plasmolysis.Cell walls permit the cells of plants, fungi and bacteria to withstand very dilute (hypotonic) external media without bursting. In such media the cells of plants, fungi and bacteria tend to take up water by osmosis. a living plant cell swells, building up pressure against the cell wall. the cell wall exerts an equal pressure against the swollen cell. Because of their walls, such cells can withstand much greater changes in the surrounding medium than animal cells.The nucleus has a double layered covering called nuclear membrane. called nuclear membrane has pores which allow the transfer of material from inside The nucleus to called nuclear membrane outside, that is, to the cytoplasm.The nucleus contains chromosomes, which are visible as rod-shaped structures only when a living plant cell is about to divide. Chromosomes contain information for inheritance of characters from parents to next generation in the form of DNA (Deoxyribo Nucleic Acid) molecules. Chromosomes are composed of DNA and protein. DNA molecules contain the information necessary for constructing and organising cells. Functional segments of DNA are called genes. In a cell which is not dividing, Functional segments of DNA is present as part of chromatin material. Chromatin material is visible as entangled mass of thread like structures. Whenever the cell is about to divide, Chromatin material gets organised into chromosomes. The nucleus plays a central role in cellular reproduction, the process by which a single cell divides and forms two new cells. The nucleus also plays a crucial part, along with the environment, in determining the way the cell will develop and what form the cell will exhibit at maturity, by directing the chemical activities of the cell. In some organisms like bacteria, the nuclear region of the cell may be poorly defined due to the absence of a nuclear membrane. Such an undefined nuclear region containing only nucleic acids is called a nucleoid. Such organisms, whose cells lack a nuclear membrane, are called prokaryotes. Organisms with cells having a nuclear membrane are called eukaryotes. Prokaryotic cells also lack most of the other cytoplasmic organelles present in eukaryotic cells. Many of the functions of such organelles are also performed by poorly organised parts of the cytoplasm. The chlorophyll in photosynthetic prokaryotic bacteria is associated with membranous vesicles but not with plastids as in eukaryotic cells.the cytoplasm is the fluid content inside a selectively permeable membrane. the cytoplasm also contains many specialised cell organelles. Each of many specialised cell organelles performs a specific function for the cell. Cell organelles are enclosed by membranes. In prokaryotes, beside the absence of a defined nuclear region, Cell organelles are also absent. On the other hand, Prokaryotic cells have nuclear membrane as well as membrane-enclosed organelles. The significance of membranes can be illustrated with the example of viruses. Viruses lack any membranes and hence do not show characteristics of life until Viruses enter a living body and use a living body cell machinery to multiply.Every cell has a membrane around Every cell to keep Every cell own contents separate from the external environment. Large and complex cells, including cells from multicellular organisms, need a lot of chemical activities to support Large and complex cells, including cells from multicellular organisms complicated structure and function. To keep these activities of different kinds separate from each other, Prokaryotic cells use membrane-bound little structures (or ‘organelles’) within Prokaryotic cells. This is one of the features of the eukaryotic cells that distinguish Prokaryotic cells from prokaryotic cells. Some of Cell organelles are visible only with an electron microscope.The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is a large network of membrane-bound tubes and sheets. It looks like long tubules or round or oblong bags (vesicles). a membrane around it is similar in structure to a membrane around it. There are two types of ER– rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER) and smooth endoplasmic reticulum (SER). RER looks rough under a microscope because RER has particles called ribosomes attached to RER surface. The ribosomes, which are present in all active cells, are the sites of protein manufacture. The manufactured proteins are then sent to various places in the cell depending on need, using the ER. The SER helps in the manufacture of fat molecules, or lipids, important for cell function. Some of these proteins and lipids help in building a membrane around it. This process is known as membrane biogenesis. Some other proteins and lipids function as enzymes and hormones. Although the ER varies greatly in appearance in different cells, the ER always forms a network system.Thus, one function of the ER is to serve as channels for the transport of materials (especially proteins) between various regions of the cytoplasm or between the cytoplasm and the nucleus. the ER the ER also functions as a cytoplasmic framework providing a surface The Golgi apparatus, first described by Camillo Golgi, consists of a system of membrane-bound vesicles (flattened sacs) arranged approximately parallel to each other in stacks called cisterns. membranes often have connections with the membranes of the ER and therefore constitute another portion of a complex cellular membrane system. The material synthesised near the ER the ER is packaged and dispatched to various targets inside and outside the cell through the Golgi apparatus. the cell functions include the storage, modification and packaging of products in vesicles. In some cases, complex sugars may be made from simple sugars in the Golgi apparatus. the Golgi apparatus is also involved in the formation of lysosomes. Camillo Golgi was born at Corteno near Brescia in 1843. Camillo Golgi studied medicine at the University of Pavia. After graduating in 1865, Camillo Golgi continued to work in Pavia at the Hospital of St. Matteo. At that time most of Camillo Golgi investigations were concerned with the nervous system, In 1872 Camillo Golgi accepted the post of Chief Medical Officer at the Hospital for the Chronically Sick at Abbiategrasso. Camillo Golgi first started Camillo Golgi investigations into the nervous system in a little kitchen of this hospital, which Camillo Golgi had converted into a laboratory. However, the work of greatest importance, which Camillo Golgi carried out was a revolutionary method of staining individual nerve and cell structures. a revolutionary method of staining individual nerve and cell structures is referred to as the ‘black reaction’. a revolutionary method of staining individual nerve and cell structures uses a weak solution of silver nitrate and is particularly valuable in tracing the processes and most delicate ramifications of cells. All through Camillo Golgi life, Camillo Golgi continued to work on these lines, modifying and improving this technique. Golgi received the highest honours and awards in recognition of Camillo Golgi work. Camillo Golgi shared the Nobel prize in 1906 with Santiago Ramony Cajal for their work on the structure of the nervous system. Structurally, Lysosomes are membrane-bound sacs filled with digestive enzymes. digestive enzymes are made by RER. Lysosomes are a kind of waste disposal system of the cell. These help to keep the cell clean by digesting any foreign material as well as worn-out cell organelles. Foreign materials entering the cell, such as bacteria or food, as well as old organelles end up in the lysosomes, which break complex substances into simpler substances. Lysosomes are able to do this because Lysosomes contain powerful digestive enzymes capable of breaking down all organic material. During the disturbance in cellular metabolism, for example, when the cell gets damaged, lysosomes may burst and digestive enzymes digest digestive enzymes own cell. Therefore, lysosomes are also known as the ‘suicide bags’ of a cell. Mitochondria are known as the powerhouses of the cell. Mitochondria have two membrane coverings. The outer membrane is porous while The outer membrane is deeply folded. These folds increase surface area for ATPgenerating chemical reactions. The energy required for various chemical activities needed for life is released by mitochondria in the form of ATP (Adenosine triphopshate) molecules. ATP is known as the energy currency of the cell. The body uses energy stored in ATP for making new chemical compounds and for mechanical work. Mitochondria are strange organelles in the sense that Mitochondria have Mitochondria own DNA and ribosomes. Therefore, mitochondria are able to make some of mitochondria own proteins. Plastids are present only in plant cells. There are two types of plastids – chromoplasts (coloured plastids) and leucoplasts (white or colourless plastids). Chromoplasts containing the pigment chlorophyll are known as chloroplasts. Chloroplasts are important for photosynthesis in plants. Chloroplasts also contain various yellow or orange pigments in addition to chlorophyll. Leucoplasts are primarily organelles in which materials such as starch, oils and protein granules are stored. The internal organisation of the Chloroplast consists of numerous membrane layers embedded in a material called the stroma. These are similar to mitochondria in external structure. Like mitochondria in external structure, plastids also have mitochondria in external structure own DNA and ribosomes. Vacuoles are storage sacs for solid or liquid contents. Vacuoles are small sized in animal cells while plant cells have very large vacuoles. The central vacuole of some plant cells may occupy 50-90% of the cell volume. In plant cells vacuoles are full of cell sap and provide turgidity and rigidity to the cell. Many substances of importance in the life of the plant cell are stored in vacuoles. These include amino acids, sugars, various organic acids and some proteins. In single-celled organisms like Amoeba, the food vacuole contains the food items that the Amoeba has consumed. In some unicellular organisms, specialised vacuoles also play important roles in expelling excess water and some wastes from the cell. Each cell thus acquires Each cell structure and ability to function because of the organisation of Each cell membrane and organelles in specific ways. Each cell thus has a basic structural organisation. This helps the cells to perform functions like respiration, obtaining nutrition, and clearing of waste material, or forming new proteins. Thus, Each cell is the fundamental structural unit of living organisms. Each cell is also the basic functional unit of life. New cells are formed in organisms in order to grow, to replace old, dead and injured cells, and to form gametes required for reproduction. The process by which new cells are made is called cell division. There are two main types of cell division: mitosis and meiosis. The process of cell division by which most of New cells divide for growth is called mitosis. In The process of cell division by which most of the cells divide for growth, each cell called mother cell divides to form two identical daughter cells. two identical daughter cells have the same number of chromosomes as mother cell. two identical daughter cells helps in growth and repair of tissues in organisms. Specific cells of reproductive organs or tissues in animals and plants divide to form gametes, which after fertilisation give rise to offspring. offspring divide by a different process called meiosis which involves two consecutive divisions. When a cell divides by meiosis a cell produces four new cells instead of just two. two identical daughter cells only have half the number of chromosomes than that of two identical daughter cells.\n","0      Cells were first discovered by Robert Hooke in...\n","1      Robert Hooke observed Cells in a cork slice wi...\n","2      Leeuwenhoek, with the improved microscope, dis...\n","3      It was Robert Brown in 1831 who discovered the...\n","4      Purkinje in 1839 coined the term ‘protoplasm’ ...\n","                             ...                        \n","165    two identical daughter cells helps in growth a...\n","166    Specific cells of reproductive organs or tissu...\n","167    offspring divide by a different process called...\n","168    When a cell divides by meiosis a cell produces...\n","169    two identical daughter cells only have half th...\n","Length: 170, dtype: object\n","\n","***TextRank Summary***\n","\n","\n","***ROUGE Score***\n","\n","[{'rouge-1': {'r': 0.42889647326507396, 'p': 1.0, 'f': 0.6003184671363063}, 'rouge-2': {'r': 0.3296114336757481, 'p': 0.9659685863874345, 'f': 0.4915084877147583}, 'rouge-l': {'r': 0.42889647326507396, 'p': 1.0, 'f': 0.6003184671363063}}]\n","\n","***BART Summary***\n","\n","\n","***ROUGE Score***\n","\n","[{'rouge-1': {'r': 0.27417519908987487, 'p': 0.9128787878787878, 'f': 0.42169728428655084}, 'rouge-2': {'r': 0.18445734702992408, 'p': 0.7071917808219178, 'f': 0.29259652523424245}, 'rouge-l': {'r': 0.2684869169510808, 'p': 0.8939393939393939, 'f': 0.41294837789984923}}]\n","\n","***Combined Summary***\n","\n","\n","***ROUGE Score***\n","\n","[{'rouge-1': {'r': 0.5039817974971559, 'p': 0.9506437768240343, 'f': 0.6587360549509931}, 'rouge-2': {'r': 0.40598481464939706, 'p': 0.8218806509945751, 'f': 0.5434977534211712}, 'rouge-l': {'r': 0.5017064846416383, 'p': 0.9463519313304721, 'f': 0.6557620772558257}}]\n","/content/drive/MyDrive/FYP/Dataset/Class9/Biology biology_class9_chapter5_coreferenced.txt\n","65\n","/content/drive/MyDrive/FYP/Dataset/Class9/Biology/Summary\n","/content/drive/MyDrive/FYP/Dataset/Class9/Biology/Summary/biology_class9_chapter5_coreferenced-Summarized.txt\n","Saved Successfully at /content/drive/MyDrive/FYP/Dataset/Class9/Biology/Summary/biology_class9_chapter5_coreferenced-Summarized.txt\n","/content/drive/MyDrive/FYP/Dataset/Class9/Biology/afterCoref/biology_class9_chapter6_coreferenced.txt\n","In unicellular organisms, a single cell performs all basic functions. For example, in Amoeba, a single cell carries out movement, intake of food, gaseous exchange and excretion. But in multicellular organisms there are millions of cells. Most of cells are specialised to carry out specific functions. Each specialised function is taken up by a different group of cells. Since cells carry out only a particular function, cells do it very efficiently. In human beings, muscle cells contract and relax to cause movement, nerve cells carry messages, blood flows to transport oxygen, food, hormones and waste material and so on. In plants, vascular tissues conduct food and water from one part of the plant to other parts. So, multi-cellular organisms show division of labour. Cells specialising in one function are often grouped together in the body. This means that a particular function is carried out by a cluster of cells at a definite place in the body. This cluster of cells, called a tissue, is arranged and designed so as to give the highest possible efficiency of function. Blood, phloem and muscle are all examples of tissues. A group of cells that are similar in structure and/or work together to achieve a particular function forms a tissue. Plants are stationary or fixed – Plants don’t move. Since Plants have to be upright, Plants have a large quantity of supportive tissue. supportive tissue generally has dead cells. Animals on the other hand move around in search of food, mates and shelter. Animals on the other hand move around in search of food, mates and shelter consume more energy as compared to plants. Most of the tissues Animals on the other hand move around in search of food, mates and shelter contain are living. Another difference between animals and plants is in the pattern of growth. The growth in plants is limited to certain regions, while this is not so in animals. There are some tissues in plants that divide throughout some tissues in plants that divide throughout their life life. some tissues in plants that divide throughout their life are localised in certain regions. Based on the dividing capacity of some tissues in plants that divide throughout their life, various plant tissues can be classified as growing or meristematic tissue and permanent tissue. Cell growth in animals is more uniform. So, there is no such demarcation of dividing and nondividing regions in animals. The structural organisation of organs and organ systems is far more specialised and localised in complex animals than even in very complex plants. This fundamental difference reflects the different modes of life pursued by these two major groups of organisms, particularly in these two major groups of organisms different feeding methods. Also, these two major groups of organisms are differently adapted for a sedentary existence on one hand (plants) and active locomotion on the other (animals), contributing to this difference in organ system design. New cells produced by meristem are initially like those of meristem itself, but as those of meristem itself grow and mature, those of meristem itself characteristics slowly change and those of meristem itself become differentiated as components of other tissues. Apical meristem is present at the growing tips of stems and roots and increases the length of the stem and the root. The girth of the stem or root increases due to lateral meristem (cambium). Intercalary meristem seen in some plants is located near the node.Cells of meristematic tissue are very active, Cells of meristematic tissue have dense cytoplasm, thin cellulose walls and prominent nuclei. Cells of meristematic tissue lack vacuoles.Differentiation leads to the development of various types of permanent tissues. A few layers of cells beneath the epidermis are generally simple permanent tissue. Parenchyma is the most common simple permanent tissue. Parenchyma consists of relatively unspecialised cells with thin cell walls. relatively unspecialised cells with thin cell walls are living cells. relatively unspecialised cells with thin cell walls are usually loosely arranged, thus large spaces between cells are found in simple permanent tissue. simple permanent tissue generally stores food.\n","0     In unicellular organisms, a single cell perfor...\n","1     For example, in Amoeba, a single cell carries ...\n","2     But in multicellular organisms there are milli...\n","3     Most of cells are specialised to carry out spe...\n","4     Each specialised function is taken up by a dif...\n","5     Since cells carry out only a particular functi...\n","6     In human beings, muscle cells contract and rel...\n","7     In plants, vascular tissues conduct food and w...\n","8     So, multi-cellular organisms show division of ...\n","9     Cells specialising in one function are often g...\n","10    This means that a particular function is carri...\n","11    This cluster of cells, called a tissue, is arr...\n","12    Blood, phloem and muscle are all examples of t...\n","13    A group of cells that are similar in structure...\n","14    Plants are stationary or fixed – Plants don’t ...\n","15    Since Plants have to be upright, Plants have a...\n","16          supportive tissue generally has dead cells.\n","17    Animals on the other hand move around in searc...\n","18    Animals on the other hand move around in searc...\n","19    Most of the tissues Animals on the other hand ...\n","20    Another difference between animals and plants ...\n","21    The growth in plants is limited to certain reg...\n","22    There are some tissues in plants that divide t...\n","23    some tissues in plants that divide throughout ...\n","24    Based on the dividing capacity of some tissues...\n","25              Cell growth in animals is more uniform.\n","26    So, there is no such demarcation of dividing a...\n","27    The structural organisation of organs and orga...\n","28    This fundamental difference reflects the diffe...\n","29    Also, these two major groups of organisms are ...\n","30    New cells produced by meristem are initially l...\n","31    Apical meristem is present at the growing tips...\n","32    The girth of the stem or root increases due to...\n","33    Intercalary meristem seen in some plants is lo...\n","34    Cells of meristematic tissue lack vacuoles.Dif...\n","35    A few layers of cells beneath the epidermis ar...\n","36    Parenchyma is the most common simple permanent...\n","37    Parenchyma consists of relatively unspecialise...\n","38    relatively unspecialised cells with thin cell ...\n","39    relatively unspecialised cells with thin cell ...\n","40       simple permanent tissue generally stores food.\n","dtype: object\n","\n","***TextRank Summary***\n","\n","\n","***ROUGE Score***\n","\n","[{'rouge-1': {'r': 0.8581314878892734, 'p': 1.0, 'f': 0.9236499019192771}, 'rouge-2': {'r': 0.7915129151291513, 'p': 0.9491150442477876, 'f': 0.8631790694876705}, 'rouge-l': {'r': 0.8581314878892734, 'p': 1.0, 'f': 0.9236499019192771}}]\n","\n","***BART Summary***\n","\n","\n","***ROUGE Score***\n","\n","[{'rouge-1': {'r': 0.8131487889273357, 'p': 0.8576642335766423, 'f': 0.8348134941154498}, 'rouge-2': {'r': 0.7029520295202952, 'p': 0.6803571428571429, 'f': 0.691470049447795}, 'rouge-l': {'r': 0.8131487889273357, 'p': 0.8576642335766423, 'f': 0.8348134941154498}}]\n","\n","***Combined Summary***\n","\n","\n","***ROUGE Score***\n","\n","[{'rouge-1': {'r': 0.972318339100346, 'p': 0.878125, 'f': 0.9228242971476026}, 'rouge-2': {'r': 0.915129151291513, 'p': 0.7106017191977078, 'f': 0.7999999950791364}, 'rouge-l': {'r': 0.972318339100346, 'p': 0.878125, 'f': 0.9228242971476026}}]\n","/content/drive/MyDrive/FYP/Dataset/Class9/Biology biology_class9_chapter6_coreferenced.txt\n","78\n","/content/drive/MyDrive/FYP/Dataset/Class9/Biology/Summary\n","/content/drive/MyDrive/FYP/Dataset/Class9/Biology/Summary/biology_class9_chapter6_coreferenced-Summarized.txt\n","Saved Successfully at /content/drive/MyDrive/FYP/Dataset/Class9/Biology/Summary/biology_class9_chapter6_coreferenced-Summarized.txt\n","/content/drive/MyDrive/FYP/Dataset/Class9/Biology/afterCoref/biology_class9_chapter7_coreferenced.txt\n","This bewildering variety of life around us has evolved on the earth over millions of years. However, us do not have more than a tiny fraction of this time to try and understand all these living organisms, so us cannot look at all these living organisms one by one. Instead, we look for similarities among the organisms, which will allow we to put all these living organisms into different classes and then study different classes or groups as a whole. In order to make relevant groups to study the variety of life forms, we need to decide which characteristics decide more fundamental differences among organisms. This would create the main broad groups of organisms. Within the main broad groups of organisms, smaller subgroups will be decided by less important characteristics.Attempts at classifying living things into groups have been made since time immemorial. Greek thinker Aristotle classified animals according to whether animals lived on land, in water or in the air. This is a very simple way of looking at life, but misleading too. A eukaryotic cell has membrane-bound organelles, including a nucleus, which allow cellular processes to be carried out efficiently in isolation from each other. Therefore, organisms which do not have a clearly demarcated nucleus and other organelles would need to have other organelles biochemical pathways organised in very different ways. This would have an effect on every aspect of cell design. Further, nucleated cells would have the capacity to participate in making a multicellular organism because nucleated cells can take up specialised functions. Therefore, nucleus can be a basic characteristic of classification.Cells that group together to form a single organism use the principle of division of labour. In such a body design, Cells that group together to form a single organism would not be identical. Instead, groups of cells will carry out specialised functions. This makes a very basic distinction in the body designs of organisms. As a result, an Amoeba and a worm are very different in an Amoeba and a worm body design.Being able to produce one’s own food versus having to get food from outside would make very different body designs.The characteristics of body design used for classification of plants will be very different from those important for classifying animals. This is because the basic designs are different, based on the need to make the basic designs own food (plants), or acquire it (animals). Therefore, these design features (having a skeleton, for example) are to be used to make sub-groups, rather than making broad groups.All living things are identified and categorised on the basis of All living things body design in form and function. Some characteristics are likely to make more wide-ranging changes in body design than others. There is a role of time in this as well. So, once a certain body design comes into existence, a certain body design will shape the effects of all other subsequent design changes, simply because a certain body design already exists. In other words, characteristics that came into existence earlier are likely to be more basic than characteristics that have come into existence later. This means that the classification of life forms will be closely related to life forms evolution.Most life forms that are see today have arisen by an accumulation of changes in body design that allow the organism possessing them to survive better. Charles Darwin first described this idea of evolution in 1859 in Charles Darwin book, \"The Origin of Species\".\n","0     This bewildering variety of life around us has...\n","1     However, us do not have more than a tiny fract...\n","2     Instead, we look for similarities among the or...\n","3     In order to make relevant groups to study the ...\n","4     This would create the main broad groups of org...\n","5     Within the main broad groups of organisms, sma...\n","6     Greek thinker Aristotle classified animals acc...\n","7     This is a very simple way of looking at life, ...\n","8     A eukaryotic cell has membrane-bound organelle...\n","9     Therefore, organisms which do not have a clear...\n","10    This would have an effect on every aspect of c...\n","11    Further, nucleated cells would have the capaci...\n","12    Therefore, nucleus can be a basic characterist...\n","13    In such a body design, Cells that group togeth...\n","14    Instead, groups of cells will carry out specia...\n","15    This makes a very basic distinction in the bod...\n","16    As a result, an Amoeba and a worm are very dif...\n","17    This is because the basic designs are differen...\n","18    Therefore, these design features (having a ske...\n","19    Some characteristics are likely to make more w...\n","20             There is a role of time in this as well.\n","21    So, once a certain body design comes into exis...\n","22    In other words, characteristics that came into...\n","23    This means that the classification of life for...\n","24    Charles Darwin first described this idea of ev...\n","dtype: object\n","\n","***TextRank Summary***\n","\n","\n","***ROUGE Score***\n","\n","[{'rouge-1': {'r': 1.0, 'p': 1.0, 'f': 0.999999995}, 'rouge-2': {'r': 0.962, 'p': 0.962, 'f': 0.961999995}, 'rouge-l': {'r': 1.0, 'p': 1.0, 'f': 0.999999995}}]\n","\n","***BART Summary***\n","\n","\n","***ROUGE Score***\n","\n","[{'rouge-1': {'r': 0.888030888030888, 'p': 0.8679245283018868, 'f': 0.877862590420503}, 'rouge-2': {'r': 0.774, 'p': 0.6660929432013769, 'f': 0.7160036953055938}, 'rouge-l': {'r': 0.8803088803088803, 'p': 0.8603773584905661, 'f': 0.8702290026342434}}]\n","\n","***Combined Summary***\n","\n","\n","***ROUGE Score***\n","\n"]},{"metadata":{"tags":null},"name":"stderr","output_type":"stream","text":["\n"," 50%|█████     | 1/2 [01:57<01:57, 117.43s/it]\u001b[A"]},{"metadata":{"tags":null},"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["[{'rouge-1': {'r': 1.0, 'p': 0.8809523809523809, 'f': 0.9367088557795226}, 'rouge-2': {'r': 0.972, 'p': 0.6952789699570815, 'f': 0.810675558106874}, 'rouge-l': {'r': 1.0, 'p': 0.8809523809523809, 'f': 0.9367088557795226}}]\n","/content/drive/MyDrive/FYP/Dataset/Class9/Biology biology_class9_chapter7_coreferenced.txt\n","62\n","/content/drive/MyDrive/FYP/Dataset/Class9/Biology/Summary\n","/content/drive/MyDrive/FYP/Dataset/Class9/Biology/Summary/biology_class9_chapter7_coreferenced-Summarized.txt\n","Saved Successfully at /content/drive/MyDrive/FYP/Dataset/Class9/Biology/Summary/biology_class9_chapter7_coreferenced-Summarized.txt\n","/content/drive/MyDrive/FYP/Dataset/Class9/Geography\n","/content/drive/MyDrive/FYP/Dataset/Class9/Geography/afterCoref/geography_class9_chapter5_coreferenced.txt\n","With about 47,000 plant species India occupies tenth place in the world and fourth in Asia in plant diversity. There are about 15,000 flowering plants in India, which account for 6 per cent in the world’s total number of flowering plants. India has many nonflowering plants, such as ferns, algae and fungi. India also has approximately 90,000 species of animals, as well as a rich variety of fish in India fresh and marine waters. Natural vegetation refers to a plant community, which has grown naturally without human aid and has been left undisturbed by humans for a long time. This is termed as a virgin vegetation. Thus, cultivated crops and fruits, orchards form part of vegetation but not natural vegetation. The term flora is used to denote plants of a particular region or period. Similarly, the species of animals are referred to as fauna.Land affects the natural vegetation directly and indirectly. The nature of land influences the type of vegetation. The fertile level is generally devoted to agriculture. The undulating and rough terrains are areas where grassland and woodlands develop and give shelter to a variety of wildlife.The soils also vary over space. Different types of soils provide basis for different types of vegetation. The sandy soils of the desert support cactus and thorny bushes, while wet, marshy, deltaic soils support mangroves and deltaic vegetation. The hill slopes with some depth of soil have conical trees.The character and extent of vegetation are mainly determined by temperature along with humidity in the air, precipitation and soil. On the slopes of the Himalayas and the hills of the Peninsula above the height of 915 metres, the fall in the temperature affects the types of vegetation and its growth, and changes its from tropical to subtropical temperate and alpine vegetation.The variation in duration of sunlight at different places is due to differences in latitude, altitude, season and duration of the day. Due to longer duration of sunlight, trees grow faster in summer.In India, almost the entire rainfall is brought in by the advancing southwest monsoon and retreating northeast monsoons. Areas of heavy rainfall have more dense vegetation as compared to areas of less rainfall.Forests are renewable resources and play a major role in enhancing the quality of environment. Forests modify local climate, control soil erosion, regulate stream flow, support a variety of industries, provide livelihood for many communities and offer panoramic or scenic view for recreation. Forests control wind force and temperature and cause rains. Forests provide humus to the soil and shelter to the wildlife. India’s natural vegetation has undergone many changes due to several factors, such as the growing demand for cultivated land, development of industries and mining, urbanisation and over-grazing of pastures.The vegetation cover of India in large parts is no more natural in the real sense. Except in some inaccessible regions, like the Himalayas, the hilly region of central India and the marusthali, the vegetation in most of the areas has been modified at some places, or replaced or degraded by human occupancy.some places are restricted to heavy rainfall areas of the Western Ghats and the island groups of Lakshadweep, Andaman and Nicobar, upper parts of Assam and Tamil Nadu coast. some places are at some places best in areas having more than 200 cm of rainfall with a short dry season. The trees reach great heights up to 60 metres or even above. Since the region is warm and wet throughout the year, the region has a luxuriant vegetation of all kinds — trees, shrubs and creepers giving the region a multilayered structure. There is no definite time for trees to shed trees leaves.Some of the commercially important trees of this forest are ebony, mahogany, rosewood, rubber and cinchona. The common animals found in some places are elephant, monkey, lemur and deer. One-horned rhinoceroses are found in the jungles of Assam and West Bengal. Besides The common animals found in these forests, plenty of birds, bats, sloth, scorpions and snails are also found in the jungles of Assam and West Bengal. Tropical deciduous forests are Tropical deciduous forests. Tropical deciduous forests are also called Tropical deciduous forests and spread over the region receiving rainfall between 200 cm and 70 cm. Trees of this forest type shed Tropical deciduous forests for about six to eight weeks in dry summer. On the basis of the availability of water, Tropical deciduous forests are further divided into moist and dry deciduous. The former is found in areas receiving rainfall between 200 and 100 cm. Tropical deciduous forests exist, therefore, mostly in the eastern part of India — northeastern states, along the foothills of the Himalayas, Jharkhand, West Odisha and Chhattisgarh, and on the eastern slopes of the Western Ghats. Teak is the most dominant species of this forest. Bamboos, sal, shisham, sandalwood, khair, kusum, arjun and mulberry are other commercially important species.Tropical deciduous forests are found in areas having rainfall between 100 cm and 70 cm. Tropical deciduous forests are found in the rainier parts of the Peninsular plateau and the plains of Bihar and Uttar Pradesh. There are open stretches, in which teak, sal, peepal and neem grow. A large part of this region has been cleared for cultivation and some parts are used for grazing. In Tropical deciduous forests, the common animals found are lion, tiger, pig, deer and elephant. A huge variety of birds, lizards, snakes and tortoises are also found here.In regions with less than 70 cm of rainfall, the natural vegetation consists of thorny trees and bushes. Thorn forests are found in the north-western part of the country, including semi-arid areas of Gujarat, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Uttar Pradesh and Haryana. Acacias, palms, euphorbias and cacti are the main plant species. Trees are scattered and have long roots penetrating deep into the soil in order to get moisture. The stems are succulent to conserve water. Leaves are mostly thick and small to minimise evaporation. Tropical deciduous forests give way to thorn forests and scrubs in arid areas.In Tropical deciduous forests, the common animals are rats, mice, rabbits, fox, wolf, tiger, lion, wild ass, horses and camels.In mountainous areas, the decrease in temperature with increasing altitude leads to the corresponding change in natural vegetation. As such, there is a succession of natural vegetation belts in the same order as we see from the tropical to the tundra region. The wet temperate type of forests are found between a height of 1000 and 2000 metres. Evergreen broad-leaf trees, such as oaks and chestnuts predominate. Between 1500 and 3000 metres, temperate forests containing coniferous trees, like pine, deodar, silver fir, spruce and cedar, are found. Montane forests cover mostly the southern slopes of the Himalayas, places having high altitude in southern and north-east India. At higher elevations, temperate grasslands are common. At high altitudes, generally, more than 3,600 metres above the sea level, temperate forests and grasslands give way to the Alpine vegetation. Silver fir, junipers, pines and birches are the common trees of temperate forests and grasslands. However, Silver fir, junipers, pines and birches get progressively stunted as Silver fir, junipers, pines and birches approach the snow-line. Ultimately, through shrubs and scrubs, Silver fir, junipers, pines and birches merge into the Alpine grasslands. Silver fir, junipers, pines and birches are used extensively for grazing by nomadic tribes, like the Gujjars and the Bakarwals. At higher altitudes, mosses and lichens form part of tundra vegetation. The common animals found in these forests are Kashmir stag, spotted dear, wild sheep, jack rabbit, Tibetan antelope, yak, snow leopard, squirrels, Shaggy horn wild ibex, bear and rare red panda, sheep and goats with thick hair. The mangrove tidal forests are found in the areas of coasts influenced by tides. Mud and silt get accumutated on such coasts. Dense mangroves are the common varieties with roots of the plants submerged under water. The deltas of the Ganga, the Mahanadi, the Krishna, the Godavari and the Kaveri are covered by such vegetation. In the GangaBrahmaputra delta, sundari trees are found, which provide durable hard timber. Palm, coconut, keora, agar, etc., also grow in some parts of the GangaBrahmaputra delta. Royal Bengal Tiger is the famous animal in Tropical deciduous forests. Turtles, crocodiles, gharials and snakes are also found in Tropical deciduous forests. Like Royal Bengal Tiger flora, India is also rich in Royal Bengal Tiger fauna. India has approximately 90,000 animal species. the country has about 2,000 species of birds. about 2,000 species of birds constitute 13% of the world’s total. There are 2,546 species of fish, which account for nearly 12% of the world’s stock. India also shares between 5 and 8 per cent of the world’s amphibians, reptiles and mammals. The elephants are the most majestic animals among the mammals. The elephants are found in the hot wet forests of Assam, Karnataka and Kerala. One-horned rhinoceroses are the other animals, which live in swampy and marshy lands of Assam and West BengalWest Bengal. Arid areas of the Rann of Kachchh and the Thar Desert are the habitat for wild ass and camels respectively. Indian bison, nilgai, chousingha, gazel and different species of deer are some other animals found in India. Indian bison, nilgai, chousingha, gazel and different species of deer also has several species of monkeys. India is the only country in the world that has both tigers and lions. The natural habitat of the Indian lion is the Gir forest in Gujarat. Tigers are found in the forests of Madhya Pradesh, the Sundarbans of West Bengal and the region. Leopards, too, are members of the cat family. Leopards are important among animals of prey.The Himalayas harbour a hardy range of animals, which survive in extreme cold. Ladakh’s freezing high altitudes are a home to yak, the shaggy horned wild ox weighing around one tonne, the Tibetan antelope, the bharal, wild sheep, and the kiang. Furhtermore, the ibex, bear, snow-leopard and rare red panda are found in certain pockets. In the rivers, lakes and coastal areas, turtles, crocodiles and gharials are found. The latter is the only representative of a variety of crocodile, found in the world today. Bird life in India is colourful. Peacocks, pheasants, ducks, parakeets, cranes and pigeons are some of the birds inhabiting the forests and wetlands of the country. About 1,300 plant species are endangered and 20 species are extinct. Quite a few animal species are also endangered and some have become extinct. The main causes for this major threat to nature are hunting by greedy hunters for commercial purposes. Pollution due to chemical and industrial waste, acid deposits, introduction of alien species and reckless cutting of the forests to bring land under cultivation and habitation, are also responsible for the imbalance.Eighteen biosphere reserves have been set up in the country to protect flora and fauna. Ten out of flora and fauna, the Sundarbans Nanda Devi, the Gulf of Mannar,the Nilgiri, Nokrek, Great Nicobar, Manas, Simlipal, Pachmarhi and Achanakmar-Amarkantak have been included in the world network of biosphere reserves.Some of the wetlands of India are popular with migratory birds. During winter, birds, such as Siberian Crane, come in large numbers. One such place favourable with birds is the Rann of Kachchh. At a place where the Thar Desert merges with the sea, flamingo with their brilliant pink plumage come in thousands to build nest mounds from the salty mud and raise their young ones. Financial and technical assistance is provided to many botanical gardens by the government since 1992.Project Tiger, Project Rhino, Project Great Indian Bustard and many other eco-developmental projects have been introduced. 101 National Parks, 553 Wildlife sanctuaries and Zoological gardens are set up to take care of natural heritage.\n","0      With about 47,000 plant species India occupies...\n","1      There are about 15,000 flowering plants in Ind...\n","2      India has many nonflowering plants, such as fe...\n","3      India also has approximately 90,000 species of...\n","4      Natural vegetation refers to a plant community...\n","                             ...                        \n","98     During winter, birds, such as Siberian Crane, ...\n","99     One such place favourable with birds is the Ra...\n","100    At a place where the Thar Desert merges with t...\n","101    Financial and technical assistance is provided...\n","102    101 National Parks, 553 Wildlife sanctuaries a...\n","Length: 103, dtype: object\n","\n","***TextRank Summary***\n","\n","\n","***ROUGE Score***\n","\n","[{'rouge-1': {'r': 0.49688667496886674, 'p': 1.0, 'f': 0.6638935063801458}, 'rouge-2': {'r': 0.4402555910543131, 'p': 0.9636363636363636, 'f': 0.6043859606072062}, 'rouge-l': {'r': 0.49688667496886674, 'p': 1.0, 'f': 0.6638935063801458}}]\n","\n","***BART Summary***\n","\n","\n","***ROUGE Score***\n","\n","[{'rouge-1': {'r': 0.3835616438356164, 'p': 0.9565217391304348, 'f': 0.5475555514695744}, 'rouge-2': {'r': 0.31884984025559104, 'p': 0.855917667238422, 'f': 0.4646182455794702}, 'rouge-l': {'r': 0.3823163138231631, 'p': 0.953416149068323, 'f': 0.5457777736917965}}]\n","\n","***Combined Summary***\n","\n","\n","***ROUGE Score***\n","\n","[{'rouge-1': {'r': 0.6127023661270237, 'p': 0.9723320158102767, 'f': 0.7517188646233254}, 'rouge-2': {'r': 0.5584664536741214, 'p': 0.8891149542217701, 'f': 0.6860282527176947}, 'rouge-l': {'r': 0.6127023661270237, 'p': 0.9723320158102767, 'f': 0.7517188646233254}}]\n","/content/drive/MyDrive/FYP/Dataset/Class9/Geography geography_class9_chapter5_coreferenced.txt\n","70\n","/content/drive/MyDrive/FYP/Dataset/Class9/Geography/Summary\n","/content/drive/MyDrive/FYP/Dataset/Class9/Geography/Summary/geography_class9_chapter5_coreferenced-Summarized.txt\n","Saved Successfully at /content/drive/MyDrive/FYP/Dataset/Class9/Geography/Summary/geography_class9_chapter5_coreferenced-Summarized.txt\n","/content/drive/MyDrive/FYP/Dataset/Class9/Geography/afterCoref/geography_class9_chapter6_coreferenced.txt\n","The people are important to develop the economy and the society. The people make and use resources and are The people resources with varying quality. Coal is but a piece of rock, until people were able to invent technology to obtain technology and make technology ‘resource’. Natural events, like a flood or a Tsunami, becomes a ‘disaster’ only when a ‘disaster’ affect a crowded village or a town. Hence, population is the pivotal element in social studies. It is the point of reference from which all other elements are observed and from which all other elements derive significance and meaning. ‘Resources’, ‘calamities’ and ‘disasters’ are all meaningful only in relation to human beings. ’ numbers, distribution, growth and characteristics or qualities provide the basic background for understanding and appreciating all aspects of the environment. Human beings are producers and consumers of earth’s resources. Therefore, it is important to know how many people are there in a country, where do how many people live, how and why how many people numbers are increasing and what are how many people characteristics. The census of India provides us with information regarding the population of our country.India’s population as on March 2011 stood at 1,210.6 million, which account for 17.5 per cent of the world’s population. These 1.21 billion people are unevenly distributed over our country vast area of 3.28 million square km, which accounts for 2.4 per cent of the world’s area.The 2011 Census data reveal that Uttar Pradesh with a population size of 199 million is the most populous state of India. Uttar Pradesh accounts for about 16 per cent of our country population. On the other hand, the most populous state of India has a population of just about 0.6 million and Lakshadweep has only 64,429 people.Almost half of India’s population lives in just five states. Almost half of India’s population are Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, Bihar, West Bengal and Uttar Pradesh. Rajasthan, the biggest state in terms of area, has only 5.5 per cent of the total population of India.Population density provides a better picture of the uneven distribution. Population density is calculated as the number of persons per unit area. India is one of the most densely populated countries of the world. The population density of India in the year 2011 was 382 persons per sq km. Densities vary from 1,102 persons per sq km in Bihar to only 17 persons per sq km in Uttar PradeshUttar Pradesh. Assam and most of just five states have moderate population densities. Hilly, dissected and rocky nature of the terrain, moderate to low rainfall, shallow and less fertile soils have influenced population densities in these areas. The Northern plains and Kerala in the south have high to very high population densities because of the flat plains with fertile soils and abundant rainfall. Population is a dynamic phenomenon. The numbers, distribution and composition of the population are constantly changing. This is the influence of the interaction of the three processes, namely — births, deaths and migrations.Since 1981, however, the rate of growth started declining gradually. During this period, birth rates declined rapidly. Still 182 million people were added to the total population in the 1990s alone It is essential to realise that India has a very large population. When a low annual rate is applied to a very large population, a low annual rate yields a large absolute increase. When more than a billion people increase even at a lower rate, the total number being added becomes very large. India’s annual increase in population is large enough to neutralise efforts to conserve the resource endowment and environment. The declining trend of the growth rate is indeed a positive indicator of the efforts of birth control. Despite that, the total additions to the population base continue to grow, and India may overtake China in 2045 to become the most populous country in the world.There are three main processes of change of population : birth rates, death rates and migration. The natural increase of population is the difference between birth rates and death rates. Birth rate is the number of live births per thousand persons in a year. Birth rate is a major component of growth because in India, birth rates have always been higher than death rates. Death rate is the number of deaths per thousand persons in a year. The main cause of the rate of growth of the Indian population has been the rapid decline in death rates. Till 1980, high birth rates and declining death rates led to a large difference between birth rates and death rates resulting in higher rates of population growth. Since 1981, birth rates have also started declining gradually, resulting in a gradual decline in the rate of population growth.The third component of population growth is migration. Migration is the movement of people across regions and territories. Migration can be internal or international.Internal migration does not change the size of the population, but influences the distribution of population within the nation. Migration plays a very significant role in changing the composition and distribution of population.In India, most migrations have been from rural to urban areas because of the “push” factor in rural areas. These are adverse conditions of poverty and unemployment in the rural areas and the “pull” of the city in terms of increased employment opportunities and better living conditions. Migration is an important determinant of population change. Migration changes not only the population size but also the population composition of urban and rural populations in terms of age and sex composition. In India, the rural-urban migration has resulted in a steady increase in the percentage of population in cities and towns. The urban population has increased from 17.29 per cent of the total population in 1951 to 31.80 per cent in 2011. There has been a significant increase in the number of ‘million plus cities’ from 35 to 53 in from 2001 to 2011.The age composition of a population refers to the number of people in different age groups in a country. It is one of the most basic characteristics of a population. To an important degree, a person’s age influences what a person’s/she needs, buys, does and a person’s/she capacity to perform. Consequently, the number and percentage of a population found within the children, working age and aged groups are notable determinants of the population’s social and economic structure.The population of a nation is, generally, grouped into three broad categories: children, working age and aged. The percentage of children and the aged affect the dependency ratio because these groups are not producers. Sex ratio is defined as the number of females per 1000 males in the population. This information is an important social indicator to measure the extent of equality between males and females in a society at a given time. The sex ratio in a country has always remained unfavourable to females. Literacy is a very important quality of a population. Obviously, only an informed and educated citizen can make intelligent choices and undertake research and development projects. Low levels of literacy are a serious obstacle for economic improvement. According to the Census 2011, a person aged 7 years and above, who can read and write with understanding in any language, is treated as literate. There has been a steady improvement in the literacy levels in India. The literacy rate in a country as per the Census of 2011 is 73 per cent; 80.9 per cent for males and 64.6 per cent for females.The percentage of population that is economically active is an important index of development. The distribution of the population according to different types of occupation is referred to as the occupational structure. An enormous variety of occupations are found in any country. Occupations are, generally, classified as primary, secondary and tertiary. Primary activities include agriculture, animal husbandry, forestry, fishing, mining and quarrying, etc. Secondary activities include manufacturing industry, building and construction work, etc. Tertiary activities include transport, communications, commerce, administration and other services. The proportion of people working in different activities varies in developed and developing countries. Developed nations have a high proportion of people in secondary, and tertiary activities. Developing countries tend to have a higher proportion of Developing countries workforce engaged in primary activities. In India, about 64 per cent of the population is engaged only in agriculture. The proportion of population dependent on secondary and tertiary sectors is about 13 and 20 per cent respectively. There has been an occupational shift in favour of secondary and tertiary sectors because of growing industrialisation and urbanisation in recent times. Health is an important component of population composition, which affects the process of development. Sustained efforts of government programmes have registered significant improvements in the health conditions of the Indian population. Death rates have declined from 25 per 1000 population in 1951 to 7.2 per 1000 in 2011 and life expectancy at birth has increased from 36.7 years in 1951 to 67.9 years in 2012. The substantial improvement is the result of many factors including improvement in public health, prevention of infectious diseases and application of modern medical practices in diagnosis and treatment of ailments. Despite considerable achievements, the health situation is a matter of major concern for India. The per capita calorie consumption is much below the recommended levels and malnutrition afflicts a large percentage of our population. Safe drinking water and basic sanitation amenities are available to only one-third of the rural population. Safe drinking water and basic sanitation amenities need to be tackled through an appropriate population policy. The most significant feature of the Indian population is the size of the Indian population adolescent population. the Indian population constitutes one-fifth of the total population of IndiaIndia. Adolescents are, generally, grouped in the age group of 10 to 19 years. Adolescents are the most important resource for the future. Nutrition requirements of adolescents are higher than those of a normal child or adult. Poor nutrition can lead to deficiency and stunted growth. But in India, the diet available to adolescents is inadequate in all nutrients. A large number of adolescent girls suffer from anaemia. A large number of adolescent girls problems have so far not received adequate attention in the process of development. The adolescent girls have to be sensitised to the problems The adolescent girls confront. Awareness among The adolescent girls can be improved through the spread of literacy and education. Recognising that the planning of families would improve individual health and welfare, the Government of India initiated a comprehensive Family Planning Programme in 1952. The Family Welfare Programme has sought to promote responsible and planned parenthood on a voluntary basis. The National Population Policy (NPP) 2000 is a culmination of years of planned efforts. The NPP 2000 provides a policy framework for imparting free and compulsory school education up to 14 years of age, reducing infant mortality rate to below 30 per 1000 live births, achieving universal immunisation of children against all vaccine preventable diseases, promoting delayed marriage for girls, and making family welfare a people-centred programme. The NPP 2000 identified adolescents as one of the major section of the population that need greater attention. Besides nutritional requirements, the policy puts greater emphasis on other important needs of adolescent including protection from unwanted pregnancies and sexually transmitted diseases. the policy called for programmes that aim towards encouraging delayed marriage and child-bearing, education of adolescents about the risks of unprotected sex, making contraceptive services accessible and affordable, providing food supplements, nutritional services, and strengthening legal measures to prevent child marriage.

India has achieved multi-faceted socioeconomic progress during the last five decades. India has moved forward displaying remarkable progress in the field of agriculture, industry, technology and overall economic development. India has also contributed significantly to the making of world history. India is a vast country. Lying entirely in the Northern hemisphere the mainland extends between latitudes 8°4'N and 37°6'N and longitudes 68°7'E and 97°25'E. The Tropic of Cancer divides India into almost two equal parts. To the southeast and southwest of the mainland, lie the Andaman and Nicobar islands and the Lakshadweep islands in Bay of Bengal and Arabian Sea respectively. The land mass of India has an area of 3.28 million square km. India’s total area accounts for about 2.4 per cent of the total geographical area of the world. India is the seventh largest country of the world. India has a land boundary of about 15,200 km and the total length of the coast line of the mainland including Andaman and Nicobar and Lakshadweep is 7,516.6 km. India is bounded by the young fold mountains in the northwest, north and north east. South of about 22° north latitude, India begins to taper, and extends towards the Indian Ocean, dividing India into two seas, the Arabian Sea on the west and the Bay of Bengal on the Arabian Sea east. From Gujarat to Arunachal Pradesh there is a time lag of two hours. Hence, time along the Standard Meridian of India passing through Mirzapur is taken as the standard time for the whole country. The latitudinal extent influences the duration of the day and night, as one moves from south to north. The Indian landmass has a central location between the East and the West Asia. India is a southward extension of the Asian Continent. The trans Indian Ocean routes which connect the countries of Europe in the West and the countries of East Asia provide a strategic central location to India. The Deccan Peninsula protrudes into the Indian Ocean, thus helping India to establish close contact with East Asia, Africa and Europe from the western coast and with Southeast and East Asia from the western coast. India has a long coastline on the Indian Ocean as India has and indeed, it is India’s eminent position in the Indian Ocean which justifies the naming of an the Indian Ocean after an Ocean. India’s contacts with the World has continued through the ages but her relationships through the land routes are much older than her maritime contacts. The various passes across the mountains in the north have provided passages to the ancient travellers, while the oceans restricted such interaction for a long time. the land routes have contributed in the exchange of ideas and commodities since ancient times. The ideas of the Upanishads and the Ramayana, the stories of Panchtantra, the Indian numerals and the decimal system thus could reach many parts of the World. The spices, muslin and other merchandise were taken from India to different countries. On the other hand, the influence of Greek sculpture, and the architectural styles of dome and minarets from West Asia can be seen in different parts of our country. India occupies an important strategic position in West Asia. India has 29 states and 7 Union Territories. India shares India land boundaries with Pakistan and Afghanistan in the northwest, China, Nepal and Bhutan in the north and Myanmar and Bangladesh in the east. Our southern neighbours across the sea consist of the two island countries, namely Sri Lanka and Maldives. Sri Lanka is separated from India by a narrow channel of sea formed by the Palk Strait and the Gulf of Mannar while Maldives Islands are situated to the south of the Lakshadweep Islands.

Geologically, the Peninsular Plateau constitutes one of the ancient landmasses on the earth’s surface. It was supposed to be one of the most stable land blocks. The Himalayas and the Northern Plains are the most recent landforms. From the view point of geology, Himalayan mountains form an unstable zone. The whole mountain system of Himalaya represents a very youthful topography with high peaks, deep valleys and fast flowing rivers. the Northern Plains are formed of alluvial deposits. the Peninsular Plateau is composed of igneous and metamorphic rocks with gently rising hills and wide valleys. The Himalayas and the Northern Plains mountains stretch over the northern borders of India. The whole mountain system of Himalaya ranges run in a west-east direction from the Indus to the Brahmaputra. Himalayas represent the loftiest and one of the most rugged mountain barriers of the world. the most rugged mountain barriers of the world form an arc, which covers a distance of about 2,400 Km. the most rugged mountain barriers of the world width varies from 400 Km in Kashmir to 150 Km in Arunachal Pradesh. The altitudinal variations are greater in the eastern half than those in the western half. Himalaya consists of three parallel ranges in Himalaya longitudinal extent. A number of valleys lie between these ranges. The northern-most range is known as the Great or Inner Himalayas or the Himadri. The northern-most range is the most continuous range consisting of the loftiest peaks with an average height of 6,000 metres. The northern-most range contains all prominent Himalayan peaks. The folds of Himalayas are asymmetrical in nature. The core of this part of Himalayas is composed of granite. The core of this part of Himalayas is perennially snow bound, and a number of glaciers descend from The northern-most range. The range lying to the south of the Himadri forms the most rugged mountain system and is known as Himachal or lesser Himalaya. The ranges are mainly composed of highly compressed and altered rocks. The altitude varies between 3,700 and 4,500 metres and the average width is of 50 Km. While the Pir Panjal range forms the longest and the most important range, the Dhaula Dhar and the Mahabharat ranges are also prominent ones. The range lying to the south of the Himadri consists of the famous valley of Kashmir, the Kangra and Kullu Valley in Himachal Pradesh. This region is well-known for This region hill stations. The outer-most range of Himalayas Himalayas is called the Shiwaliks. They extend over a width of 10-50 Km and have an altitude varying between 900 and 1100 metres. These ranges are composed of unconsolidated sediments brought down by rivers from the main Himalayan ranges located farther north. These ranges are covered with thick gravel and alluvium. The longitudinal valley lying between lesser Himalaya and the Shiwaliks are known as Duns. Dehra Dun, Kotli Dun and Patli Dun are some of Duns. Besides the longitudinal divisions, Himalayas have been divided on the basis of regions from west to east. the longitudinal divisions have been demarcated by river valleys. For example, the part of Himalayas lying between Indus and Satluj has been traditionally known as Punjab Himalaya but Punjab Himalaya is also known regionally as Kashmir and Himachal Himalaya from west to east respectively. The part of Himalayas lying between Satluj and Kali rivers is known as Kumaon Himalayas. The Kali and Teesta rivers demarcate Kumaon Himalayas and the part lying between Teesta and Dihang rivers is known as Assam Himalayas. There are regional names also in these broad categories. Find out some regional names of Himalayas The Brahmaputra marks the eastern-most boundary of Himalayas. Beyond the Dihang gorge, Himalayas bend sharply to the south and spread along the eastern boundary of India. They are known as the Purvachal or the Eastern hills and mountains. These hills running through the north-eastern states are mostly composed of strong sandstones, which are sedimentary rocks. Covered with dense forests, These hills running through the north-eastern states mostly run as parallel ranges and valleys. The Purvachal comprises the Patkai hills, the Naga hills, the Manipur hills and the Mizo hills. The Northern Plain has been formed by the interplay of the three major river systems, namely — the Indus, the Ganga and The Brahmaputra along with the three major river systems, namely — the Indus, the Ganga and the Brahmaputra tributaries. The Northern Plain is formed of alluvial soil. The deposition of alluvium in a vast basin lying at the foothills of the Himalaya over millions of years, formed this fertile plain. The deposition of alluvium in a vast basin lying at the foothills of the Himalaya over millions of years spreads over an area of 7 lakh sq. km. The plain being about 2400 km long and 240 to 320 km broad, is a densely populated physiographic division. With a rich soil cover combined with adequate water supply and favourable climate a rich soil cover is agriculturally a productive part of India. The rivers coming from northern mountains are involved in depositional work. In the lower course, due to gentle slope, the velocity of the river decreases, which results in the formation of riverine islands. The rivers in riverine islands lower course split into numerous channels due to the deposition of silt. numerous channels are known as distributaries. The Northern Plain is broadly divided into three sections. The Western part of The Northern Plain is referred to as the Punjab Plains. Formed by the Indus and The Northern Plain tributaries, the larger part of this plain lies in Pakistan. The Indus and Indus tributaries — the Jhelum, the Chenab, the Ravi, the Beas and the Satluj originate in the Himalaya. This section of The Northern Plain is dominated by the doabs. The Northern Plain extends between Ghaggar and Teesta rivers. The Northern Plain is spread over North India in Haryana, Delhi, U.P., Bihar, partly Jharkhand and West Bengal. In the East, particularly in Assam lies the Brahmaputra plain. the Punjab Plains are generally described as flat land with no variations in the Punjab Plains relief. It is not true. the Punjab Plains also have diverse relief features. According to the variations in relief features, the Punjab Plains can be divided into four regions. The rivers, after descending from the mountains deposit pebbles in a narrow belt of about 8 to 16 km in width lying parallel to the slopes of the Shiwaliks. the Shiwaliks is known as bhabar. All the streams disappear in this bhabar belt. South of this bhabar belt, Streams re-emerge and create a wet, swampy and marshy region known as terai. This was a thickly forested region full of wildlife. The forests have been cleared to create agricultural land and to settle migrants from Pakistan after partition. Locate Dudhwa National Park in a thickly forested region full of wildlife. The largest part of the northern plain is formed of older alluvium. The largest part of the northern plain lies above the floodplains of the rivers and presents a terracelike feature. The largest part of the northern plain is known as bhangar. The soil in a thickly forested region full of wildlife contains calcareous deposits, locally known as kankar. calcareous deposits, locally known as kankar are called khadar. calcareous deposits, locally known as kankar are renewed almost every year and so are fertile, thus, ideal for intensive agriculture. The Peninsular plateau is a tableland composed of the old crystalline, igneous and metamorphic rocks. The Peninsular plateau was formed due to the breaking and drifting of agricultural land and thus, making The Peninsular plateau a part of the oldest landmass. The Peninsular plateau has broad and shallow valleys and rounded hills. The Peninsular plateau consists of two broad divisions, namely, the Central Highlands and The Peninsular plateau. The part of The Peninsular plateau lying to the north of the Narmada river, covering a major area of The Peninsular plateau, is known as the Central Highlands. The Vindhyan range is bounded by the Satpura range on the south and the Aravalis on the northwest. The further westward extension gradually merges with the sandy and rocky desert of Rajasthan. The flow of the rivers draining this region, namely the Chambal, the Sind, the Betwa and the Ken is from southwest to northeast, thus indicating the slope. the Central Highlands are wider in the west but narrower in the east. The eastward extensions of The Peninsular plateau are locally known as the Bundelkhand and Baghelkhand. The Peninsular plateau marks the further eastward extension, drained by the Narmada river. The Peninsular plateau is a triangular landmass that lies to the south of the Narmada river. The Satpura range flanks The Peninsular plateau broad base in the north, while the Mahadev, the Kaimur hills and the Maikal range form The Peninsular plateau eastern extensions. Locate These hills running through the north-eastern states and ranges in the Physical map of India. The Peninsular plateau is higher in the west and slopes gently eastwards. An extension of The Peninsular plateau The Peninsular plateau is also visible in northeast, locally known as the Meghalaya, Karbi-Anglong Plateau and North Cachar Hills. It is separated by a fault from The Peninsular plateau. Three prominent hill ranges from the west to the East are the Garo, the Khasi and the Jaintia Hills. The Western Ghats and the Eastern Ghats mark the western and the eastern edges of The Peninsular plateau The Peninsular plateau respectively. The Western Ghats lie parallel to the Coromandel Coast. The Western Ghats are continuous and can be crossed through passes only. The Western Ghats are higher than the Eastern Ghats. The Western Ghats average elevation is 900– 1600 metres as against 600 metres of the Eastern Ghats. the Eastern Ghats stretch from the Mahanadi Valley to the Nigiris in the south. the Eastern Ghats are discontinuous and irregular and dissected by rivers draining into the Bay of West Bengal. The Western Ghats cause orographic rain by facing orographic rain bearing moist winds to rise along the western slopes of The Western Ghats. The Western Ghats are known by different local names. The height of The Western Ghats progressively increases from north to south. The highest peaks include the Anai Mudi (2,695 metres) and the Doda Betta (2,637 metres). Mahendragiri (1,501 metres) is the highest peak in the Eastern Ghats. Shevroy Hills and the Javadi Hills are located to the southeast of the Eastern Ghats. Locate the famous hill stations of Udagamandalam, popularly known as Ooty and the Kodaikanal. One of the distinct features of The Peninsular plateau is the black soil area known as Decean Trap. This is of volcanic origin, hence, the rocks are igneous. Actually, the rocks have denuded over time and are responsible for the formation of black soil. Shevroy Hills lie on the western and northwestern margins of The Peninsular plateau. These are highly eroded hills and are found as broken hills. These extend from Gujarat to Delhi in a southwest-northeast direction. The Indian desert lies towards the western margins of Shevroy Hills. The Indian desert is an undulating sandy plain covered with sand dunes. a thickly forested region full of wildlife receives very low rainfall below 150 mm per year. a thickly forested region full of wildlife has arid climate with low vegetation cover. Streams appear during the rainy season. Soon after Streams disappear into the sand as Streams do not have enough water to reach the Arabian Sea. Luni is the only large river in a thickly forested region full of wildlife. Barchans (crescent-shaped dunes) cover larger areas but longitudinal dunes become more prominent near the Indo-Pakistan boundary. If you visit Jaisalmer, you may go to see a group of barchans. The Peninsular plateau is flanked by stretch of narrow coastal strips, running along the Arabian Sea on the west and the Bay of Bengal on the East. the Coromandel Coast, sandwiched between The Western Ghats and the Arabian Sea, is a narrow plain. a narrow plain consists of three sections. The northern part of the Coromandel Coast is called the Konkan (Mumbai – Goa), the central stretch is called The Northern Plain, while the southern stretch is referred to as the Coromandel Coast. the Punjab Plains the Bay of Bengal are wide and level. In The northern part of the coast, the Punjab Plains is referred to as the Northern Circar, while the southern part is known as the Coromandel Coast. Large rivers, such as the Mahanadi, the Godavari, the Krishna and the Kaveri have formed extensive delta on the Coromandel Coast. Lake Chilika is an important feature along the Coromandel Coast. Locate the Lakshadweep Islands group lying close to the Coromandel Coast. the Lakshadweep Islands group is composed of small coral isalnds. Earlier the Lakshadweep Islands group were known as Laccadive, Minicoy and Amindive. In 1973, the Lakshadweep Islands group were named as Lakshadweep. Lake Chilika covers small area of 32 sq km. Kavaratti island is the administrative headquarters of Lakshadweep. the Lakshadweep Islands group has great diversity of flora and fauna. The Pitti island, which is uninhabited, has a bird sanctuary. The Pitti island, which is uninhabited are Andaman and Nicobar islands. The Pitti island, which is uninhabited are bigger in size and are more numerous and scattered. the Lakshadweep Islands group is divided into two broad categories – The Andaman in the north and the Nicobar in the south. The Andaman in the north and the Nicobar in the south is believed that islands are an elevated portion of submarine mountains. islands are of great strategic importance for islands. There is great diversity of flora and fauna in the Lakshadweep Islands group too. islands lie close to equator and experience equatorial climate and has thick forest cover. submarine mountains are the major sources of water and forest wealth. the Punjab Plains are the granaries of islands. the Punjab Plains provide the base for early civilisations. The Peninsular plateau is a storehouse of minerals, which has played a crucial role in the industrialisation of islands. The coastal region and island groups provide sites for fishing and port activities. Thus, the diverse physical features of agricultural land have immense future possibilities of development.\n","0      The land of India displays great physical vari...\n","1      Geologically, the Peninsular Plateau constitut...\n","2      It was supposed to be one of the most stable l...\n","3      The Himalayas and the Northern Plains are the ...\n","4      From the view point of geology, Himalayan moun...\n","                             ...                        \n","153      the Punjab Plains are the granaries of islands.\n","154    the Punjab Plains provide the base for early c...\n","155    The Peninsular plateau is a storehouse of mine...\n","156    The coastal region and island groups provide s...\n","157    Thus, the diverse physical features of agricul...\n","Length: 158, dtype: object\n","\n","***TextRank Summary***\n","\n","\n","***ROUGE Score***\n","\n","[{'rouge-1': {'r': 0.35006784260515605, 'p': 1.0, 'f': 0.5185929609828843}, 'rouge-2': {'r': 0.279537149817296, 'p': 0.9542619542619543, 'f': 0.43240696776239607}, 'rouge-l': {'r': 0.35006784260515605, 'p': 1.0, 'f': 0.5185929609828843}}]\n","\n","***BART Summary***\n","\n","\n","***ROUGE Score***\n","\n","[{'rouge-1': {'r': 0.3242876526458616, 'p': 0.8884758364312267, 'f': 0.47514910144988926}, 'rouge-2': {'r': 0.23081607795371498, 'p': 0.7178030303030303, 'f': 0.34930875207808193}, 'rouge-l': {'r': 0.3242876526458616, 'p': 0.8884758364312267, 'f': 0.47514910144988926}}]\n","\n","***Combined Summary***\n","\n","\n","***ROUGE Score***\n","\n","[{'rouge-1': {'r': 0.5169606512890095, 'p': 0.927007299270073, 'f': 0.6637630616052915}, 'rouge-2': {'r': 0.428136419001218, 'p': 0.8061926605504587, 'f': 0.5592680941166256}, 'rouge-l': {'r': 0.5169606512890095, 'p': 0.927007299270073, 'f': 0.6637630616052915}}]\n","/content/drive/MyDrive/FYP/Dataset/Class9/Geography geography_class9_chapter2_coreferenced.txt\n","70\n","/content/drive/MyDrive/FYP/Dataset/Class9/Geography/Summary\n","/content/drive/MyDrive/FYP/Dataset/Class9/Geography/Summary/geography_class9_chapter2_coreferenced-Summarized.txt\n","Saved Successfully at /content/drive/MyDrive/FYP/Dataset/Class9/Geography/Summary/geography_class9_chapter2_coreferenced-Summarized.txt\n","/content/drive/MyDrive/FYP/Dataset/Class9/Geography/afterCoref/geography_class9_chapter3_coreferenced.txt\n","The term drainage describes the river system of an area. Look at the physical map. You will notice that small streams flowing from different directions come together to form the main river, which ultimately drains into a large water body such as a lake or a sea or an ocean. an area drained by a single river system is called a drainage basin. A closer observation on a map will indicate that any elevated area, such as a mountain or an upland, separates two drainage basins. Such an upland is known as a water divide. The drainage systems of India are mainly controlled by the broad relief features of the subcontinent. Accordingly, the Indian rivers are divided into two major groups: the Himalayan rivers; and the Peninsular rivers. Apart from originating from the two major physiographic regions of India, the Himalayan and the Peninsular rivers are different from each other in many ways. Most of the Indian rivers are perennial. It means that they have water throughout the year. the Indian rivers receive water from rain as well as from melted snow from the lofty mountains. The two major Himalayan rivers, the Indus and the Brahmaputra originate from the north of the mountain ranges. The two major Himalayan rivers, the Indus and the Brahmaputra have cut through the lofty mountains making gorges. the Indian rivers have long courses from the Indian rivers source to the sea. the Indian rivers perform intensive erosional activity in the Indian rivers upper courses and carry huge loads of silt and sand. In the middle and the lower courses, the Indian rivers form meanders, oxbow lakes, and many other depositional features in the Indian rivers floodplains. the Indian rivers also have welldeveloped deltas. A large number of the Indian rivers are seasonal, as the Indian rivers flow is dependent on rainfall. During the dry season, even the large rivers have reduced flow of water in even the large rivers channels. the Indian rivers have shorter and shallower courses as compared to the Indian rivers Himalayan counterparts. However, some of their Himalayan counterparts originate in the central highlands and flow towards the west. Can you identify two such large rivers? Most of the Indian rivers originate in the Western Ghats and flow towards the Bay of Bengal. the Indian rivers Himalayan are the Indus, the Ganga and the Brahmaputra. the Indian rivers are long, and are joined by many large and important tributaries. A river alongwith its tributaries may be called a river system. The river Indus rises in Tibet, near Lake Mansarowar. Flowing west, The river Indus enters India in the Ladakh. The river Indus forms a picturesque gorge in this part. Several tributaries, the Zaskar, the Nubra, the Shyok and the Hunza, join The river Indus in the Kashmir region. The river Indus The river Indus flows through Baltistan and Gilgit and emerges from the mountains at Attock. The Satluj, the Beas, the Ravi, the Chenab and the Jhelum join together to enter The river Indus in Pakistan. Beyond this, The river Indus flows southwards eventually reaching the Arabian Sea, east of Karachi. The river Indus has a very gentle slope. With a total length of 2900 km, The river Indus The river Indus is one of the longest rivers of the world. A little over a third of The river Indus is located in India Ladakh, Jammu and Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh and Punjab and the rest is in Pakistan. The headwaters of the Ganga, called the ‘Bhagirathi’ is fed by the Gangotri Glacier and joined by the Alaknanda at Devaprayag in Uttarakhand. At Haridwar, the Ganga emerges from the mountains on to the plains. the Ganga the Ganga is joined by many tributaries from the Himalayas, a few of them being major rivers, such as the Yamuna, the Ghaghara, the Gandak and the Kosi. The river Yamuna rises from the Gangotri Glacierthe Himalayas. The river flows parallel to the Ganga the Ganga and as a right bank tributary meets the Ganga at Allahabad. The Ghaghara, the Gandak and the Kosi rise in the Nepal Himalaya. The Ghaghara, the Gandak and the Kosi rise in the Nepal Himalaya are the rivers, which flood parts of the plains every year, causing widespread damage to life and property, whereas, The Ghaghara, the Gandak and the Kosi rise in the Nepal Himalaya enrich the soil for agricultural use. The main tributaries, which come from the peninsular uplands, are the Chambal, the Betwa and the Son. These rise from semi-arid areas, have shorter courses and do not carry much water in These. Enlarged with the waters from the waters right and left bank tributaries, the Ganga flows eastwards till Farakka in West Bengal. This is the northernmost point of the Sundarban Delta. The river bifurcates here; the Bhagirathi-Hooghly (a distributary) flows southwards through the deltaic plains to the Bay of West Bengal. The mainstream, flows southwards into Bangladesh and is joined by the Brahmaputra. Further downstream, The mainstream is known as the Meghna. This mighty river, with waters from the Ganga and the Brahmaputra, flows into the Bay of Bengal. The delta formed by these rivers is known as the Sundarban Delta. The length of the Ganga is over 2500 km. Ambala is located on the water divide between the Indus and the the Ganga river systems. The plains from Ambala to the Sunderban stretch over nearly 1800 km, but the fall in the Sunderban slope is hardly 300 metres. In other words, there is a fall of just one metre for every 6 km. Therefore, The river develops large meanders. the Brahmaputra the Brahmaputra rises in Tibet east of Mansarowar lake very close to the sources of the Indus and the Satluj. It is slightly longer than Indus, and most of Indus course lies outside India. Indus flows eastwards parallel to the Himalayas. On reaching the Namcha Barwa (7757 m), Indus takes a ‘U’ turn and enters India in Arunachal Pradesh through a gorge. Here, Indus is called the Dihang and the Dihang is joined by the Dibang, the Lohit, and many other tributaries to form the Brahmaputra in Assam. In Tibet, The river carries a smaller volume of water and less silt as The river is a cold and a dry area. In India, The river passes through a region of high rainfall. Here The river carries a large volume of water and considerable amount of silt. the Brahmaputra has a braided channel in the Brahmaputra entire length in Assam and forms many riverine islands. Every year during the rainy season, The river overflows The river banks, causing widespread devastation due to floods in Assam and Bangladesh. Unlike other north Indian rivers, the Brahmaputra the Brahmaputra is marked by huge deposits of silt on the Brahmaputra bed causing the riverbed to rise. The river also shifts The river channel frequently. The main water divide in India is formed by the Western Ghats, which runs from north to south close to the western coast. Most of the major rivers of the Peninsula, such as the Mahanadi, the Godavari, the Krishna and the Kaveri flow eastwards and drain into the Bay of Bengal. the major rivers of the Peninsula, such as the Mahanadi, the Godavari, the Krishna and the Kaveri flow eastwards and drain into the Bay of Bengal make deltas at the major rivers of the Peninsula, such as the Mahanadi, the Godavari, the Krishna and the Kaveri flow eastwards and drain into the Bay of Bengal mouths. There are numerous small streams flowing west of the Western Ghats. The Narmada and the Tapi are the only long rivers, which flow west and make esturies. The drainage basins of the peninsular rivers are comparatively smaller in size. Narmada rises in the Amarkantak hills in Madhya Pradesh. Narmada flows towards the west in a rift valley formed due to faulting. On Narmada way to the sea, Narmada creates many picturesque locations. The ‘Marble rocks’, near Jabalpur, where Narmada Narmada flows through a deep gorge, and the ‘Dhuadhar falls, where the river plunges over steep rocks, are some of the notable ones. All tributaries of Narmada are very short and most of these join the main stream at right angles. The river Indus Narmada covers parts of Madhya Pradesh . the Tapi rises in the Satpura ranges, in the Betul district of Madhya Pradesh. the Tapi also flows in a rift valley parallel to Narmada but the Tapi is much shorter in length. the Tapi covers parts of Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat and Maharashtra. The coastal plains between Western Ghats and the Arabian Sea are very narrow. Hence, the coastal rivers are short. the coastal rivers are Sabarmati, Mahi, Bharathpuzha and Periyar. The Godavari is The river. The Godavari rises from the slopes of the Western Ghats in the Betul district of Madhya PradeshMaharashtra. The Godavari length is about 1500 km. The Godavari drains into the Bay of BengalBengal. The Godavari is also the largest among the peninsular rivers. The river Indus covers parts of Maharashtra (about 50 per cent of The river Indus lies in Maharashtra), Madhya Pradesh, Odisha and Madhya Pradesh. The Godavari is joined by a number of tributaries, such as the Purna, the Wardha, the Pranhita, the Manjra, the Wainganga and the Penganga. The last three tributaries are very large. Because of The Godavari length and the area The Godavari covers, The Godavari is also known as the Ganga. The Mahanadi rises in the highlands of Chhattisgarh. The Mahanadi flows through Odisha to reach the Bay of BengalBengal. The length of The river is about 860 km. The river is shared by Maharashtra, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, and Odisha. Rising from a spring near Mahabaleshwar, the Krishna flows for about 1400 km and reaches the Bay of BengalBengal. The Tungabhadra, the Koyana, the Ghatprabha, the Musi and the Bhima are some of the Bhima tributaries. the Bhima is shared by Maharasthra, Karnataka and Madhya PradeshMadhya Pradesh. The Kaveri rises in the Brahmagri range of the Western Ghats and The Kaveri reaches the Bay of Bengal in south of Cuddalore in Tamil Nadu. The total length of The river is about 760 km. The river main tributaries are Amravati, Bhavani, Hemavati and Kabini. The river drains parts of Karnataka, Kerala and Tamil Nadu. Besides these major rivers, there are some smaller rivers flowing towards the east. The Damoder, the Brahmani, the Baitarni and the Subarnrekha are some notable examples. India has many lakes. These differ from each other in size and other characteristics. Most lakes are permanent; some contain water only during the rainy season, like the lakes in the basins of inland drainage of semi-arid regions. There are some lakes which are the result of the action of glaciers and ice sheets, while others have been formed by wind, river action and human activities. A meandering river across a floodplain forms cut-offs that later develops into ox-bow lakes. Spits and bars form lagoons in the coastal areas, e.g. the Chilika lake, the Pulicat lake and the Kolleru lake. Lakes in the region of inland drainage are sometimes seasonal; for example, the Sambhar lake in Rajasthan, which is a salt water lake. Lakes in the region of inland drainage water is used for producing salt. Most of Most lakes are in the region of inland drainage. They are of glacial origin. In other words, They formed when glaciers dug out a basin, which was later filled with snowmelt. The Wular lake in Jammu and Kashmir, in contrast, is the result of tectonic activity. The Wular lake in Jammu and Kashmir is the largest freshwater lake in India. The Dal lake, Bhimtal, Nainital, Loktak and Barapani are some other important freshwater lakes. Apart from natural lakes, the damming of the rivers for the generation of hydel power has also led to the formation of lakes, such as Guru Gobind Sagar (Bhakra Nangal Project). Lakes are of great value to human beings. A lake helps to regulate the flow of a river. During heavy rains, A lake prevents flooding and during the dry season, A lake helps to maintain an even flow of water. Lakes can also be used for developing hydel power. Lakes moderate the climate of the surroundings; maintain the aquatic ecosystem, enhance natural beauty, help develop tourism and provide recreation. Rivers have been of fundamental importance throughout the human history. Water from rivers is a basic natural resource, essential for various human activities. Therefore, riverbanks have attracted settlers from ancient times. These settlements have now become big cities. Using rivers for irrigation, navigation, hydro-power generation is of special significance — particularly to a country like India, where agriculture is the major source of livelihood of the majority of agriculture population. The growing domestic, municipal, industrial and agricultural demand for water from rivers naturally affects the quality of water. As a result, more and more water is being drained out of the rivers reducing more and more water volume. On the other hand, a heavy load of untreated sewage and industrial effluents are emptied into the rivers. This affects not only the quality of water but also the self-cleansing capacity of The river. For example, given the adequate streamflow, the Ganga water is able to dilute and assimilate pollution loads within 20 km of large cities. But the increasing urbanisation and industrialisation do not allow the increasing urbanisation and industrialisation to happen and the pollution level of many rivers has been rising.\n","0      The term drainage describes the river system o...\n","1                              Look at the physical map.\n","2      You will notice that small streams flowing fro...\n","3      an area drained by a single river system is ca...\n","4      A closer observation on a map will indicate th...\n","                             ...                        \n","137    As a result, more and more water is being drai...\n","138    On the other hand, a heavy load of untreated s...\n","139    This affects not only the quality of water but...\n","140    For example, given the adequate streamflow, th...\n","141    But the increasing urbanisation and industrial...\n","Length: 142, dtype: object\n","\n","***TextRank Summary***\n","\n","\n","***ROUGE Score***\n","\n","[{'rouge-1': {'r': 0.38764044943820225, 'p': 1.0, 'f': 0.5587044494150044}, 'rouge-2': {'r': 0.3169811320754717, 'p': 0.9581749049429658, 'f': 0.47637050666119335}, 'rouge-l': {'r': 0.38764044943820225, 'p': 1.0, 'f': 0.5587044494150044}}]\n","\n","***BART Summary***\n","\n","\n","***ROUGE Score***\n","\n","[{'rouge-1': {'r': 0.34129213483146065, 'p': 0.9135338345864662, 'f': 0.4969325113772526}, 'rouge-2': {'r': 0.24968553459119497, 'p': 0.7561904761904762, 'f': 0.3754137078517178}, 'rouge-l': {'r': 0.33707865168539325, 'p': 0.9022556390977443, 'f': 0.4907975420520992}}]\n","\n","***Combined Summary***\n","\n","\n","***ROUGE Score***\n","\n","[{'rouge-1': {'r': 0.5407303370786517, 'p': 0.9436274509803921, 'f': 0.6874999953683673}, 'rouge-2': {'r': 0.45345911949685536, 'p': 0.8277841561423651, 'f': 0.5859406699493324}, 'rouge-l': {'r': 0.5365168539325843, 'p': 0.9362745098039216, 'f': 0.6821428525112246}}]\n","/content/drive/MyDrive/FYP/Dataset/Class9/Geography geography_class9_chapter3_coreferenced.txt\n","70\n","/content/drive/MyDrive/FYP/Dataset/Class9/Geography/Summary\n","/content/drive/MyDrive/FYP/Dataset/Class9/Geography/Summary/geography_class9_chapter3_coreferenced-Summarized.txt\n","Saved Successfully at /content/drive/MyDrive/FYP/Dataset/Class9/Geography/Summary/geography_class9_chapter3_coreferenced-Summarized.txt\n","/content/drive/MyDrive/FYP/Dataset/Class9/Geography/afterCoref/geography_class9_chapter4_coreferenced.txt\n","Climate refers to the sum total of weather conditions and variations over a large area for a long period of time (more than thirty years). Weather refers to the state of the atmosphere over an area at any point of time. The elements of weather and climate are the same, i.e. temperature, atmospheric pressure, wind, humidity and precipitation. You may have observed that the weather conditions fluctuate very often even within a day. But there is some common pattern over a few weeks or months, i.e. days are cool or hot, windy or calm, cloudy or bright, and wet or dry. On the basis of the generalised monthly atmospheric conditions, the year is divided into seasons such as winter, summer or rainy seasons. The climate of India is described as the ‘monsoon’ type. In Asia, this type of climate is found mainly in the south and the southeast. Despite an overall unity in the general pattern, there are perceptible regional variations in climatic conditions within India. Let us take two important elements – temperature and precipitation, and examine how they vary from place to place and season to season. In summer, the mercury occasionally touches 50°C in some parts of the Rajasthan desert, whereas the mercury may be around 20°C in Pahalgam in Jammu and Kashmir. On a winter night, temperature at Drass in Jammu and Kashmir Kashmir may be as low as minus 45°C. Thiruvananthapuram, on the other hand, may have a temperature of 22°C. Let us now look at precipitation. There are variations not only in the form and types of precipitation but also in Thiruvananthapuram amount and the seasonal distribution. While precipitation is mostly in the form of snowfall in the upper parts of Himalayas, it rains over the rest of the country. The annual precipitation varies from over 400 cm in Meghalaya to less than 10 cm in Ladakh and western Rajasthan. Most parts of the country receive rainfall from June to September. But some parts like the Peruvian Coast gets a large portion of the Peruvian Coast rain during October and November. In general, coastal areas experience less contrasts in temperature conditions. Seasonal contrasts are more in the interior of the country. There is decrease in rainfall generally from east to west in the Northern Plains. These variations have given rise to variety in lives of people – in terms of the food they eat, the clothes they wear and also the kind of houses they live in. There are six major controls of the climate of any place. they are: latitude, altitude, pressure and wind system, distance from the sea (continentality), ocean currents and relief features. Due to the curvature of the earth, the amount of solar energy received varies according to latitude. As a result, air temperature generally decreases from the equator towards the poles. As one goes from the surface of the earth to higher altitudes, the atmosphere becomes less dense and temperature decreases. The hills are therefore cooler during summers. The pressure and wind system of any area depend on the latitude and altitude of the place. Thus it influences the temperature and rainfall pattern. The sea exerts a moderating influence on climate: As the distance from the sea increases, it moderating influence decreases and the people experience extreme weather conditions. This condition is known as continentality (i.e. very hot during summers and very cold during winters). Ocean currents along with onshore winds affect the climate of the coastal areas, For example, any coastal area with warm or cold currents flowing past example, will be warmed or cooled if the winds are onshore. Finally, relief too plays a major role in determining the climate of a place. High mountains act as barriers for cold or hot winds; they may also cause precipitation if they are high enough and lie in the path of rain-bearing winds. The leeward side of mountains remains relatively dry. The Tropic of Cancer passes through the middle of the country from the Rann of Kuchchh in the west to Mizoram in the east. Almost half of the country, lying south of The Tropic of Cancer, belongs to the tropical area. All the remaining area, north of The Tropic of Cancer, lies in the sub-tropics. Therefore, India’s climate has characteristics of tropical as well as subtropical climates. India has mountains to the north, which have an average height of about 6,000 metres. India also has a vast coastal area where the maximum elevation is about 30 metres. The Himalayas prevent the cold winds from Central Asia from entering the subcontinent. It is because of these mountains that the subcontinent experiences comparatively milder winters as compared to Central Asia. The climate and associated weather conditions in India are governed by the following atmospheric conditions: Pressure and surface winds; Upper air circulation; and Western cyclonic disturbances and troical cyclones. India lies in the region of north easterly winds. the cold winds from Central Asia originate from the subtropical high-pressure belt of the northern hemisphere. the cold winds from Central Asia blow southwards, get deflected to the right due to the Coriolis force, and move towards the equatorial low-pressure area. Generally, the cold winds from Central Asia carry little moisture as the cold winds from Central Asia originate and blow over land. Therefore, the cold winds from Central Asia bring little or no rain. Hence, India should have been an arid land, but India is not so. The pressure and wind conditions over India are unique. During winter, there is a high-pressure area north of The Himalayas. Cold dry winds blow from the region of north easterly winds to the low-pressure areas over the oceans to the south. In summer, a low-pressure area develops over interior Asia, as well as, over IndiaIndia. This causes a complete reversal of the direction of winds during summer. Air moves from the high-pressure area over the southern Indian Ocean, in a south-easterly direction, crosses the equator, and turns right towards the low-pressure areas over the Indian subcontinent. These are known as the Southwest Monsoon winds. the Southwest Monsoon winds blow over the oceans, gather moisture and bring widespread rainfall over the mainland of India. The upper air circulation in the region of north easterly winds is dominated by a westerly flow. An important component of a westerly flow is the jet stream. These jet streams are located approximately over 27°-30° north latitude, therefore, These jet streams are known as subtropical westerly jet streams. Over India, These jet streams blow south of the Himalayas, all through the year except in summer. The western cyclonic disturbances experienced in the north and north-western parts of India are brought in by a westerly flow. In summer, the subtropical westerly jet stream moves north of the Himalayas with the apparent movement of the sun. An easterly jet stream, called the sub-tropical easterly jet stream blows over peninsular India, approximately over 14°N during the summer months. The climate of India is strongly influenced by monsoon winds. The sailors who came to India in historic times were one of the first to have noticed the phenomenon of The Monsoon. The sailors who came to India in historic times benefited from the reversal of the wind system as The sailors who came to India in historic times came by sailing ships at the mercy of winds. The Arabs, who had also come to India as traders named this seasonal reversal of the wind system ‘monsoon’. The monsoons are experienced in the tropical area roughly between 20° N and 20° S. To understand the mechanism of The monsoons, the following facts are important. The differential heating and cooling of land and water creates low pressure on the landmass of India while the seas around experience comparatively high pressure. The shift of the position of Inter Tropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) in summer, over the Ganga plain (this is the equatorial trough normally positioned about 5°N of the equator. this is also known as the monsoontrough during the monsoon season). The presence of the high-pressure area, east of Madagascar, approximately at 20°S over the Indian Ocean. The intensity and position of this high-pressure area affects the Indian Monsoon. The Tibetan plateau gets intensely heated during summer, which results in strong vertical air currents and the formation of low pressure over The Tibetan plateau at about 9 km above sea level. The movement of the westerly jet stream to the north of the Himalayas and the presence of the tropical easterly jet stream over the Indian peninsula during summer. Apart from this, it has also been noticed that changes in the pressure conditions over the southern oceans also affect the monsoons. Normally when the tropical eastern south Pacific Ocean experiences high pressure, the Indian Ocean experiences low pressure. But in certain years, there is a reversal in the pressure conditions and the eastern Pacific has lower pressure in comparison to Indian Ocean. This periodic change in pressure conditions is known as the Southern Oscillation or SO. The difference in pressure over Tahiti (Pacific Ocean, 18°S/149°W) and Darwin in northern Australia (Indian Ocean, 12°30’S/131°E) is computed to predict the intensity of the monsoons. If the pressure differences were negative, it would mean below average and late monsoons. A feature connected with the SO is the El Nino phenomenon in which a warm ocean current that flows past the Peruvian Coast, in place of the cold Peruvian current, every 2 to 5 years. The changes in pressure conditions are connected to El Nino. Hence, the phenomenon is referred to as ENSO (El Nino Southern Oscillations). The Monsoon, unlike the trades, are not steady winds but are pulsating in nature, affected by different atmospheric conditions encountered by it, on it way over the warm tropical seas. The duration of The Monsoon is between 100- 120 days from early June to mid-September. Around the time of its arrival, the normal rainfall increases suddenly and continues constantly for several days. This is known as the ‘burst’ of The Monsoon, and can be distinguished from the pre-monsoon showers. The Monsoon arrives at the southern tip of the Indian peninsula generally by the first week of June. Subsequently, its proceeds into two – the Arabian Sea branch and the Bay of Bengal branch. two – the Arabian Sea branch and the Bay of Bengal branch reaches Mumbai about ten days later on approximately the 10th of June. This is a fairly rapid advance. the Bay of Bengal branch also advances rapidly and arrives in Assam in the first week of June. The lofty mountains causes The Monsoon winds to deflect towards the west over the Northern Plains. By mid-June the Arabian Sea branch of The Monsoon arrives over Saurashtra-Kuchchh and the central part of the country. Arabian Sea and the Bay of Bengal Bengal branches of The Monsoon merge over the northwestern part of the Northern Plains. Delhi generally receives the monsoon showers from the Bay of Bengal branch Bengal by the end of June (tentative date is 29th of June). By the first week of July, western Uttar Pradesh, Punjab, Haryana and eastern Rajasthan experience The Monsoon. By mid-July, The Monsoon reaches Himachal Pradesh and the rest of the country Withdrawal or the retreat of The Monsoon is a more gradual process (Figure 4.4). The withdrawal of The Monsoon begins in northwestern states of India by early September. By mid-October, The withdrawal of the monsoon withdraws completely from the northern half of the Indian peninsula. The withdrawal from the southern half of the Indian peninsula is fairly rapid. By early December, The Monsoon has withdrawn from the rest of the country. the country receive the very first monsoon showers, progressively from south to north, from the last week of April to the first week of May. The withdrawal, takes place progressively from north to south from the first week of December to the first week of January. By this time the rest of the country is already under the influence of the Indian Monsoon. The monsoon type of climate is characterised by a distinct seasonal pattern. The weather conditions greatly change from one season to the other. These changes are particularly noticeable in the interior parts of the country. The coastal areas do not experience much variation in temperature though there is variation in rainfall pattern. Four main seasons can be identified in India – the cold weather season, the hot weather season, the advancing monsoon and the retreating monsoon with some regional variations. The cold weather season begins from mid- November in India India and stays till February. December and January are the coldest months in the northwestern part of the Ganga plains. The temperature decreases from south to the north. The average temperature of Chennai, on the eastern coast, is between 24° – 25° Celsius, while in the Northern Plains, it ranges between 10°C and 15° Celsius. Days are warm and nights are cold. Frost is common in the north and the higher slopes of the Himalayas experience snowfall. During The cold weather season, the northeast trade winds prevail over India. the northeast trade winds blow from land to sea and hence, for most part of India, it is a dry season. Some amount of rainfall occurs on the eastern coast from the northeast trade winds as, here the northeast trade winds blow from sea to land. In the northern part of India, a feeble high-pressure region develops, with light winds moving outwards from the tropical area. Influenced by the relief, the northeast trade winds blow through the Ganga valley from the west and the northwest. The weather is normally marked by clear sky, low temperatures and low humidity and feeble, variable winds. A characteristic feature of the cold weather season over the Northern Plains is the inflow of cyclonic disturbances from the west and the northwestthe northwest. These low-pressure systems, originate over the Mediterranean Sea and western Asia and move into India, along with a westerly flow. These low-pressure systems cause the much-needed winter rains over the plains and snowfall in the mountains. Although the total amount of winter rainfall locally known as ‘mahawat’ is small, These low-pressure systems are of immense importance for the cultivation of ‘rabi’ crops. the region of north easterly winds does not have a welldefined cold season. There is hardly any noticeable seasonal change in temperature pattern during winters due to the moderating influence of Arabian Sea. Due to the apparent northward movement of the sun, the global heat belt shifts northwards. As such, from March to May, it is hot weather season in India. The influence of the shifting of the heat belt can be seen clearly from temperature recordings taken during March-May at different latitudes. In March, the highest temperature is about 38° Celsius, recorded on The Tibetan plateau. In April, temperatures in Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh are around 42° Celsius. In May, temperature of 45° Celsius is common in the northwestern parts of the country. In India, temperatures remain lower due to the moderating influence of the oceans. The summer months experience rising temperature and falling air pressure in the northern part of the country. Towards the end of May, an elongated low-pressure area develops in the region of north easterly winds extending from the Thar Desert in the northwest to Patna and Chotanagpur plateau in the east and southeast. Circulation of air begins to set in around this trough. A striking feature of the hot weather season is the ‘loo’. These are strong, gusty, hot, dry winds blowing during the day over the north and northwestern India. Sometimes These even continue until late in the evening. Direct exposure to the northeast trade winds may even prove to be fatal. Dust storms are very common during the month of May in IndiaIndia. Dust storms bring temporary relief as Dust storms lower the temperature and may bring light rain and cool breeze. This is also the season for localised thunderstorms, associated with violent winds, torrential downpours, often accompanied by hail. In Bengal, Dust storms are known as the ‘Kaal Baisakhi’. Towards the close of the summer season, pre-monsoon showers are common especially, in Kerala and Karnataka. Kerala and Karnataka help in the early ripening of mangoes, and are often referred to as ‘mango showers’. By early June, the low-pressure condition over the Northern Plains intensifies. the low-pressure condition over the northern plains attracts, the trade winds of the southern hemisphere. the trade winds of the southern hemisphere originate over the warm subtropical areas of the southern oceans. the trade winds of the southern hemisphere cross the equator and blow in a southwesterly direction entering the Indian peninsula as the Indian Monsoon. As the trade winds of the southern hemisphere blow over warm oceans, the trade winds of the southern hemisphere bring abundant moisture to the subcontinent. the trade winds of the southern hemisphere are strong and blow at an average velocity of 30 km per hour. With the exception of the extreme north-west, the trade winds of the southern hemisphere cover the country in about a month. The inflow of the south-west monsoon into India brings about a total change in the weather. Early in The cold weather season, the windward side of the Western Ghats receives very heavy rainfall, more than 250 cm. The Tibetan plateau and parts of Madhya Pradesh also receive some amount of rain in spite of lying in the tropical area. The maximum rainfall of The cold weather season is received in the northwestern part of the Ganga plains. Mawsynram in the southern ranges of the Khasi Hills receives the highest average rainfall in the world. Rainfall in the Ganga valley decreases from the east to the west. Rajasthan and parts of Gujarat get scanty rainfall. Another phenomenon associated with The Monsoon is The Monsoon tendency to have ‘breaks’ in rainfall. Thus, The Monsoon has wet and dry spells. In other words, the monsoon rains take place only for a few days at a time. They are interspersed with rainless intervals. These breaks in monsoon are related to the movement of this trough. For various reasons, the trough and its axis keep on moving northward or southward, which determines the spatial distribution of rainfall. When the axis of this trough lies over the Northern Plains, rainfall is good in these parts. On the other hand, whenever the axis shifts closer to the Himalayas, there are longer dry spells in the Northern Plains, and widespread rain occur in the mountainous catchment areas of the Himalayan rivers. the monsoon rains bring in the monsoon rains wake, devastating floods causing damage to life and property in the Northern Plains. The frequency and intensity of tropical depressions too, determine the amount and duration of monsoon rains. tropical depressions form at the head of the Bay of Bengal Bengal and cross over to the mainland. tropical depressions follow the axis of the “monsoon trough of low pressure”. The Monsoon is known for The Monsoon uncertainties. The alternation of dry and wet spells vary in intensity, frequency and duration. While it causes heavy floods in one part, it may be responsible for droughts in the other. It is often irregular in It arrival and It retreat. Hence, It sometimes disturbs the farming schedule of millions of farmers all over India. During October-November, with the apparent movement of the sun towards the south, the monsoon trough or the low-pressure trough over the Northern Plains becomes weaker. This is gradually replaced by a high-pressure system. The south-west monsoon winds weaken and start withdrawing gradually. By the beginning of October, The Monsoon withdraws from the Northern Plains. The months of October-November form a period of transition from hot rainy season to dry winter conditions. the retreat of the monsoon is marked by clear skies and rise in temperature. While day temperatures are high, nights are cool and pleasant. The land is still moist. Owing to the conditions of high temperature and humidity, the weather becomes rather oppressive during the day. This is commonly known as ‘October heat’. In the second half of October, the mercury begins to fall rapidly in IndiaIndia. The low-pressure conditions, over IndiaIndia, get transferred to the Bay of Bengal Bengal by early November. This shift is associated with the occurrence of cyclonic depressions, which originate over Arabian Sea. These cyclones generally cross the eastern coasts of India cause heavy and widespread rain. These cyclones are often very destructive. The thickly populated deltas of the Godavari, the Krishna and the Kaveri are frequently struck by cyclones, which cause great damage to life and property. Sometimes, These cyclones arrive at the coasts of Odisha, Bengal and Bangladesh. The bulk of the rainfall of the eastern coast is derived from depressions and cyclones. Parts of western coast and northeastern India receive over about 400 cm of rainfall annually. However, it is less than 60 cm in western Rajasthan and adjoining parts of Gujarat, Haryana and Punjab. Rainfall is equally low in the interior of The Tibetan plateau, and east of the Sahyadris. A third area of low precipitation is around Leh in Jammu and Kashmir. The rest of India receives moderate rainfall. Snowfall is restricted to the region of north easterly winds. Owing to the nature of monsoons, the annual rainfall is highly variable from year to year. Variability is high in the regions of low rainfall, such as parts of Rajasthan, Gujarat and the leeward side of the Western Ghats. As such, while areas of high rainfall are liable to be affected by floods, areas of low rainfall are drought-prone. You have already known the way the Himalayas protect the subcontinent from extremely cold winds from central Asia. This enables India India to have uniformly higher temperatures compared to other areas on the same latitudes. Similarly, The Tibetan plateau, under the influence of Arabian Sea from three sides, has moderate temperatures. Despite such moderating influences, there are great variations in the temperature conditions. Nevertheless, the unifying influence of the monsoon on the Indian subcontinent is quite perceptible. The seasonal alteration of the wind systems and the associated weather conditions provide a rhythmic cycle of seasons. Even the uncertainties of rain and uneven distribution are very much typical of the monsoons.

Year after year, people of India from north to south and from east to west, eagerly await the arrival of The Monsoon. the trade winds of the southern hemisphere bind the country by providing water to set the agricultural activities in motion.

Later, 10,000 B.C.E. people were nomadic could cultivate land and produce rice, wheat and other food crops. Thus, was born ‘Agriculture’.When plants of the same kind are cultivated at one place on a large scale, ‘Agriculture’.When plants of the same kind is called a crop. For example, crop of wheat means that all the plants grown in a field are that of wheat. crops are of different types like cereals, vegetables and fruits. These can be classified on the basis of the season in which These grow. India is a vast country. The climatic conditions like temperature, humidity and rainfall vary from one region to another. Accordingly, there is a rich variety of crops grown in different parts of India. Despite this diversity, two broad cropping patterns can be identified.The crops which are sown in the rainy season are called kharif crops. The rainy season in India is generally from June to September. Paddy, maize, soyabean, groundnut and cotton are kharif crops.kharif crops are called rabi crops. Examples of rabi crops are wheat, gram, pea, mustard and linseed. Besides these, pulses and vegetables are grown during summer at many places.Cultivation of crops involves several activities undertaken by farmers over a period of time.The preparation of soil is the first step before growing a crop. One of the most important tasks in agriculture is to turn the soil and loosen the soil. This allows the roots to penetrate deep into the soil. the soil allows the roots to breathe easily even when the soil go deep into the soil.the soil helps in the growth of earthworms and microbes present in the soil. These organisms are friends of the farmer since These organisms further turn and loosen the soil and add humus to it.dead plants and animals get decomposed by soil organisms. In this way, various nutrients in the dead organisms are released back into the soil. various nutrients in the dead organisms are again absorbed by plants.Since only a few centimetres of the top layer of soil supports plant growth, turning and loosening of soil brings the nutrient-rich soil to the top so that plants can use various nutrients in the dead organisms. Thus,turning and loosening of soil is very important for cultivation of crops.The process of loosening and turning of the soil is called tilling or ploughing. This is done by using a plough. Ploughs are made of wood or iron. If the soil is very dry, the soil may need watering before ploughing. The ploughed field may have big clumps of soil called crumbs. It is necessary to break big clumps of soil called crumbs. Levelling The ploughed field is beneficial for sowing as well as for irrigation. Levelling of soil is done with the help of a leveller. Sometimes, manure is added to the soil before tilling. Plough helps in proper mixing of manure with soil. the soil is moistened before sowing.Before sowing the seeds, it is necessary to break soil clumps to get better yield. This is done with the help of various tools. The main tools used for this purpose are the plough, hoe and cultivator.This is being used since ancient times for tilling the soil, adding fertilisers to the crop, removing the weeds and turning the soil. This is made of wood and is drawn by a pair of bulls or other animals. This contains a strong triangular iron strip called ploughshare. The main part of Plough is a long log of wood which is called a ploughshaft. There is a handle at one end of the shaft. one end of the shaft is attached to a beam which is placed on the bulls’ necks. One pair of bulls and a man can easily operate Plough.Plough is increasingly being replaced by iron ploughs nowadays.Plough is a simple tool which is used for removing weeds and for loosening the soil. Plough has a long rod of wood or iron. A strong, broad and bent plate of iron is fixed to one of Plough ends and works like a blade. Plough is pulled by animals.Nowadays ploughing is done by tractor-driven cultivator. The use of cultivator saves labour and time.Sowing is an important part of crop production. Before sowing, good quality, clean and healthy seeds of a good variety—are selected. Farmers prefer to use seeds which give high yield.Before sowing, one of the important tasks is to know about the tools used for sowing seeds.The tool used traditionally for sowing seeds is shaped like a funnel. The seeds are filled into a funnel, passed down through two or three pipes having sharp ends. sharp ends pierce into the soil and place seeds there.Nowadays the seed drill is used for sowing with the help of tractors. This sows The seeds uniformly at equal distance and depth. This ensures that seeds get covered by the soil after sowing. This protects seeds from being eaten by birds. Sowing by using a seed drill saves time and labour.Appropriate distance between The seeds is necessary to avoid overcrowding of plants. This allows plants to get sufficient sunlight, nutrients and water from the soil. At times a few plants may have to be removed to prevent overcrowding. The substances which are added to the soil in the form of nutrients for the healthy growth of plants are called manure and fertilisers.Soil supplies mineral nutrients to a few plants. Soil supplies mineral nutrients to the crop plants are essential for the growth of plants. In certain areas, farmers grow crop after crop in the same field. the same field is never left uncultivated or fallow.Continuous cultivation of crops makes the soil poor in nutrients. Therefore, farmers have to add manure to the fields to replenish the soil with nutrients. This process is called manuring. Improper or insufficient manuring results in weak plants. Manure is an organic substance obtained from the decomposition of plant or animal wastes. Farmers dump plant and animal waste in pits at open places and allow plant and animal to decompose. the decomposition of plant or animal wastes is caused by some microorganisms. The decomposed matter is used as organic manure.Fertilisers are chemicals which are rich in a particular nutrient.Fertilisers are produced in factories. Some examples of fertilisers are— urea, ammonium sulphate, super phosphate, potash, NPK.The use of fertilisers has helped farmers to get better yield of crops such as wheat, paddy and maize. But excessive use of fertilisers has made the soil less fertile. Fertilisers have also become a source of water pollution. Therefore, in order to maintain the fertility of the soil, we have to substitute fertilisers with organic manure or leave the field uncultivated in between two crops. The use of manure improves soil texture as well as as well water retaining capacity. as well replenishes the soil with nutrients. Another method of replenishing the soil with nutrients is through crop rotation. This can be done by growing different crops alternately. Earlier, farmers in northern India used to grow legumes as fodder in one season and wheat in the next season. This helped in the replenishment of the soil with nitrogen. Farmers are being encouraged to adopt this practice.Rhizobium bacteria are present in the nodules of roots of leguminous plants. Rhizobium bacteria fix atmospheric nitrogen.The organic manure is considered better than fertilisers.All living beings need water to live. Water is important for proper growth and development. Water is absorbed by the plant roots. Along with water, minerals and fertilisers are also absorbed. Plants contain nearly 90% water. Water is essential because germination of seeds does not take place under dry conditions. Nutrients dissolved in water are transported to each part of the plant. Water also protects the crop from both frost and hot air currents. To maintain the moisture of the soil for healthy crop growth, fields have to be watered regularly. The supply of water to crops at regular intervals is called irrigation. The time and frequency of irrigation varies from crop to crop, soil to soil and season to season. In summer, the frequency of watering is higher.The sources of water for irrigation are wells, tubewells, ponds, lakes, rivers, dams and canals.The water available in wells, lakes and canals is lifted up by different methods in different regions, for taking it to the fields. Cattle or human labour is used in different methods in different regions. So different methods in different regions are cheaper, but less efficient.Pumps are commonly used for lifting water. Diesel, biogas, electricity and solar energy is used to run Pumps.Modern methods of irrigation help us to use water economically. Sprinkler system is more useful on the uneven land where sufficient water is not available. The perpendicular pipes, having rotating nozzles on top, are joined to the main pipeline at regular intervals. When water is allowed to flow through the main pipe under pressure with the help of a pump, the main pipe escapes from the rotating nozzles. the main pipe gets sprinkled on the crop as if the main pipe is raining. Sprinkler is very useful for lawns, coffee plantation and several other crops.In Drip system, water falls drop by drop directly near the roots. So water is called drip system. water is the best technique for watering fruit plants, gardens and trees.Water is not wasted at all. Water is a boon in regions where availability of water is poor.In a field many other undesirable plants may grow naturally along with the crop. many other undesirable plants are called weeds. The removal of weeds is called weeding. Weeding is necessary since weeds compete with the crop plants for water, nutrients, space and light. Thus, Weeding affect the growth of the crop. Some weeds interfere even in harvesting and may be poisonous for animals and human beings.Farmers adopt many ways to remove weeds and control Farmers growth. Tilling before sowing of crops helps in uprooting and killing of weeds, which may then dry up and get mixed with the soil. The best time for The removal of weeds is before weeds produce flowers and seeds. The removal of weeds includes physical removal of weeds by uprooting or cutting weeds close to the ground, from time to time. This is done with the help of a khurpi. A seed drill is also used to uproot weeds. weeds are also controlled by using certain chemicals, called weedicides, like 2,4-D. These are sprayed in the fields to kill weeds. These do not damage the crops. The weedicides are diluted with water to the extent required and sprayed in the fields with a sprayer.Spraying of weedicides may affect the health of farmers. So the health of farmers should use these chemicals very carefully. the health of farmers should cover the health of farmers nose and mouth with a piece of cloth during spraying of these chemicals.Harvesting of a crop is an important task. The cutting of crop after it is mature is called harvesting. In harvesting, crops are pulled out or cut close to the ground. It usually takes 3 to 4 months for a cereal crop to mature. Harvesting in our country is either done manually by sickle or by a machine called harvester. In the harvested crop, the grain seeds need to be separated from the chaff. This process is called threshing. This is carried out with the help of a machine called ‘combine’ which is in fact a harvester as well as a thresher.Farmers with small holdings of land do the separation of grain and chaff by winnowing.Storage of produce is an important task. If the harvested grains are to be kept for longer time, the harvested grains should be safe from moisture, insects, rats and microorganisms. Harvested grains have more moisture. If freshly harvested grains are stored without drying, freshly harvested grains may get spoilt or attacked by organisms, making freshly harvested grains unfit for use or for germination. Hence, before storing freshly harvested grains, the harvested grains are properly dried in the sun to reduce the moisture in freshly harvested grains. This prevents the attack by insect pests, bacteria and fungi.Farmers store grains in jute bags or metallic bins. However, large scale storage of grains is done in silos and granaries to protect Farmers store grains in jute bags or metallic bins from pests like rats and insects.Dried neem leaves are used for storing food grains at home. For storing large quantities of grains in big godowns, specific chemical treatments are required to protect specific chemical treatments from pests and microorganisms.Many people living in the coastal areas consume fish as a major part of Many people living in the coastal areas diet.animals reared at home or in farms, have to be provided with proper food, shelter and care. When this is done on a large scale, this is called animal husbandry.\n","0      Animals including humans can not make Animals ...\n","1      energy from food is utilised by organisms for ...\n","2      humans receive food from plants, or animals, o...\n","3                                   people were nomadic.\n","4                                          10,000 B.C.E.\n","                             ...                        \n","132    Hence, before storing freshly harvested grains...\n","133    This prevents the attack by insect pests, bact...\n","134    However, large scale storage of grains is done...\n","135    For storing large quantities of grains in big ...\n","136    When this is done on a large scale, this is ca...\n","Length: 137, dtype: object\n","\n","***TextRank Summary***\n","\n","\n","***ROUGE Score***\n","\n","[{'rouge-1': {'r': 0.4753004005340454, 'p': 1.0, 'f': 0.6443438870351713}, 'rouge-2': {'r': 0.3694412770809578, 'p': 0.96, 'f': 0.5335528984156213}, 'rouge-l': {'r': 0.4753004005340454, 'p': 1.0, 'f': 0.6443438870351713}}]\n","\n","***BART Summary***\n","\n","\n","***ROUGE Score***\n","\n","[{'rouge-1': {'r': 0.33377837116154874, 'p': 0.8896797153024911, 'f': 0.4854368892361392}, 'rouge-2': {'r': 0.22120866590649943, 'p': 0.7171903881700554, 'f': 0.3381263580525477}, 'rouge-l': {'r': 0.33377837116154874, 'p': 0.8896797153024911, 'f': 0.4854368892361392}}]\n","\n","***Combined Summary***\n","\n","\n","***ROUGE Score***\n","\n","[{'rouge-1': {'r': 0.5901201602136181, 'p': 0.9344608879492601, 'f': 0.7234042505742111}, 'rouge-2': {'r': 0.4823261117445838, 'p': 0.8253658536585365, 'f': 0.6088521004178385}, 'rouge-l': {'r': 0.5901201602136181, 'p': 0.9344608879492601, 'f': 0.7234042505742111}}]\n","/content/drive/MyDrive/FYP/Dataset/Class8/Biology biology_class8_chapter1_coreferenced.txt\n","77\n","/content/drive/MyDrive/FYP/Dataset/Class8/Biology/Summary\n","/content/drive/MyDrive/FYP/Dataset/Class8/Biology/Summary/biology_class8_chapter1_coreferenced-Summarized.txt\n","Saved Successfully at /content/drive/MyDrive/FYP/Dataset/Class8/Biology/Summary/biology_class8_chapter1_coreferenced-Summarized.txt\n","/content/drive/MyDrive/FYP/Dataset/Class8/Biology/afterCoref/biology_class8_chapter2_coreferenced.txt\n","There are other living organisms around us which we normally cannot see. other living organisms around us which we normally cannot see are called microorganisms or microbes.microorganisms or microbes are so small in size that other living organisms around us which we normally cannot see cannot be seen with the unaided eye.Microorganisms are classified into four major groups. four major groups are bacteria, fungi, protozoa and some algae. Viruses are also microscopic but are different from other microorganisms. Viruses, however, reproduce only inside the cells of the host organism, which may be a bacterium, plant or animal. Common ailments like cold, influenza and most coughs are caused by viruses. Serious diseases like polio and chicken pox are also caused by viruses. Serious diseases like polio and chicken pox are caused by protozoa whereas typhoid and tuberculosis are bacterial diseases.Microorganisms may be single-celled like bacteria, some algae and protozoa, or multicellular, such as many algae and fungi. Microorganisms live in all types of environment, ranging from ice cold climate to hot springs; and deserts to marshy lands. Microorganisms are also found inside the bodies of animals including humans. Some microorganisms grow on other organisms while others exist freely.Microorganisms play an important role in our lives. Some of Microorganisms are beneficial in many ways whereas some others are harmful and cause diseases. Microorganisms are used for various purposes. Microorganisms are used in the preparation of curd, bread and cake.Microorganisms are also used in cleaning up of the environment. For example, the organic wastes are broken down into harmless and usable substances by bacteria. Bacteria are also used in the preparation of medicines. In agriculture Bacteria are used to increase soil fertility by fixing nitrogen.Curd contains several microorganisms. Of several microorganisms, the bacterium, Lactobacillus promotes the formation of curd. Lactobacillus multiplies in milk and converts Lactobacillus into curd. Bacteria are also involved in the making of cheese, pickles and many other food items.? Bacteria and yeast are also helpful for fermentation of rice idlis and dosa batter.Yeast reproduces rapidly and produces carbon dioxide during respiration. Bubbles of the gas fill the dough and increase Bubbles of the gas volume.This is the basis of the use of yeast in the baking industry for making breads, pastries and cakes.Microorganisms are used for the large scale production of alcohol, wine and acetic acid.Yeast is used for commercial production of alcohol and wine. For this purpose yeast is grown on natural sugars present in grains like barley, wheat, rice, crushed fruit juices, etc.This process of conversion of sugar into alcohol is known as fermentation. The medicines that kill or stop the growth of the disease-causing microorganisms are called antibiotics. These days a number of antibiotics are being produced from bacteria and fungi. Streptomycin, tetracycline and erythromycin are some of the commonly known antibiotics which are made from fungi and bacteria. a number of antibiotics are manufactured by growing specific microorganisms and are used to cure a variety of diseases. Antibiotics are even mixed with the feed of livestock and poultry to check microbial infection in animals. Antibiotics are also used to control many plant diseases.It is important to remember that antibiotics should be taken only on the advice of a qualified doctor. Also you must complete the course prescribed by a qualified doctor. If you take antibiotics when not needed or in wrong doses, you take antibiotics may make the drug less effective when you might need you take antibiotics in future. Also antibiotics taken unnecessarily may kill the beneficial bacteria in the body. Antibiotics, however, are not effective against cold and flu as these are caused by viruses.In 1929, Alexander Fleming was working on a culture of diseasecausing bacteria. Suddenly Alexander Fleming found the spores of a little green mould in one of Alexander Fleming culture plates. Alexander Fleming observed that the presence of mould prevented the growth of bacteria. In fact, the presence of mould prevented the growth of bacteria also killed many of bacteria. From this the mould penicillin was prepared.When a disease-carrying microbe enters our body, our body produces antibodies to fight the invader. our body also remembers how to fight a disease-carrying microbe if our body enters again. If dead or weakened microbes are introduced into a healthy body, a healthy body fights and kills the invading bacteria by producing suitable antibodies. suitable antibodies remain in a healthy body and we are protected from the disease-causing microbes for ever. This is how a vaccine works. Several diseases, including cholera, tuberculosis, smallpox and hepatitis can be prevented by vaccination.A worldwide campaign against smallpox has finally led to A worldwide campaign against smallpox eradication from most parts of the world. These days vaccines are made on a large scale from microorganisms to protect humans and other animals from several diseases.Some bacteria are able to fix nitrogen from the atmosphere to enrich soil with nitrogen and increase A worldwide campaign against smallpox fertility. dead or weakened microbes are commonly called biological nitrogen fixers. Microorganisms decompose dead organic waste of plants and animals converting Microorganisms into simple substances. simple substances are again used by other plants and animals. Thus, microorganisms can be used to degrade the harmful and smelly substances and thereby clean up the environment.Microorganisms are harmful in many ways. Some of Microorganisms cause diseases in human beings, plants and animals. Such disease-causing microorganisms are called pathogens. Some microorganisms spoil food, clothing and leather.Pathogens enter our body through the air our breathe, the water our drink or the food our eat. Pathogens can also get transmitted by direct contact with an infected person or carried by an animal. Microbial diseases that can spread from an infected person to a healthy person through air, water, food or physical contact are called communicable diseases. Examples of such diseases include cholera, common cold, chicken pox and tuberculosis.When a person suffering from common cold sneezes, fine droplets of moisture carrying thousands of viruses are spread in the air. The virus may enter the body of a healthy person while breathing and cause infection.There are some insects and animals which act as carriers of diseasecausing microbes. Housefly is one such carrier. The flies sit on the garbage and animal excreta. Pathogens stick to Pathogens bodies. When The flies sit on uncovered food The flies may transfer Pathogens. Whoever eats uncovered food they may transfer the pathogens is likely to get sick. So, it is advisable to always keep food covered. Avoid consuming uncovered items of food. Another example of a carrier is the female Anopheles mosquito, which carries the parasite of malaria. Female Aedes mosquito acts as carrier of dengue virus.All mosquitoes breed in water. Hence, one should not let water collect anywhere, in coolers, tyres, flower pot, etc. By keeping the surroundings clean and dry we can prevent mosquitoes from breeding.Several microorganisms not only cause diseases in humans and plants, but also in other animals. For example, anthrax is a dangerous human and cattle disease caused by a bacterium. a dangerous human and cattle disease caused by a bacterium is caused by a virus.Several microorganisms cause diseases in plants like wheat, rice, potato, sugarcane, orange, apple and others. diseases in plants like wheat, rice, potato, sugarcane, orange, apple and others reduce the yield of crops.Food poisoning could be due to the consumption of food spoilt by some microorganisms. Microorganisms that grow on our food sometimes produce toxic substances. These make our food poisonous causing serious illness and even death. So, it is very important that we preserve food to prevent food from being spoilt.Bread left unused under moist conditions is attacked by fungus. Microorganisms spoil our food. Spoiled food emits bad smell and has a bad taste and changed colour.Salts and edible oils are the common chemicals generally used to check the growth of microorganisms. Therefore Salts and edible oils are called preservatives. Salt or acid preservatives are added to pickles to prevent the attack of microbes. Sodium benzoate and sodium metabisulphite are common preservatives. Sodium benzoate and sodium metabisulphite are also used in jams and squashes to check Sodium benzoate and sodium metabisulphite spoilage.Common salt has been used to preserve meat and fish for ages. Meat and fish are covered with dry salt to check the growth of microorganisms. Salting is also used to preserve amla, raw mangoes, tamarind, etc.Jams, jellies and squashes are preserved by sugar. Sugar reduces the moisture content which inhibits the growth of bacteria which spoil food.Use of oil and vinegar prevents spoilage of pickles because bacteria cannot live in such an environment. Vegetables, fruits, fish and meat are often preserved by this method.Pasteurised milk can be consumed without boiling as Pasteurised milk is free from harmful microbes. Pasteurised milk is heated to about 700C for 15 to 30 seconds and then suddenly chilled and stored. By doing so, Pasteurised milk prevents the growth of microorganisms. This process of conversion of sugar into alcohol was discovered by Louis Pasteur. This process of conversion of sugar into alcohol is called pasteurisation.These days dry fruits and even vegetables are sold in sealed air tight packets to prevent the attack of microbes.Rhizobium lives in the root nodules of leguminous plants, such as beans and peas, with which Rhizobium has a symbiotic relationship. Sometimes nitrogen gets fixed through the action of lightning. Our atmosphere has 78% nitrogen gas. Nitrogen is one of the essential constituents of all living organisms as part of proteins, chlorophyll, nucleic acids and vitamins. Nitrogen cannot be taken directly by plants and animals. Certain bacteria and blue green algae present in the soil fix nitrogen from the atmosphere and convert Nitrogen into compounds of nitrogen. Once nitrogen is converted into compounds of nitrogen, nitrogen can be utilised by plants from the soil through plants from the soil root system. Nitrogen is then used for the synthesis of plant proteins and other compounds. Animals feeding on plants get these proteins and other nitrogen compounds.When plants and animals die, bacteria and fungi present in the soil convert the nitrogenous wastes into nitrogenous compounds to be used by plants again. Certain other bacteria convert some part of Certain other bacteria to nitrogen gas which goes back into the atmosphere.

A great variety of plants and animals are essential for the well-being and survival of mankind. Today, a major threat to survival of these organisms is deforestation. Deforestation means clearing of forests and using that land for other purposes.Some natural causes of deforestation are forest fires and severe droughts. Deforestation disturbs the balance in nature. If cutting of trees continues, rainfall and the fertility of the soil will decrease. Moreover, there will be increased chances of natural calamities such as floods and droughts.Fewer trees would mean that less carbon dioxide will be used up resulting in its increased amount in the atmosphere. This will lead to global warming as carbon dioxide traps the heat rays reflected by earth. The increase in temperature on earth disturbs the water cycle and may reduce rainfall. This could cause droughts. Deforestation is a major cause which leads to the change in soil properties. Physical properties of the soil get affected by plantation and vegetation.Fewer trees result in more soil erosion. Removal of the top layer of the soil exposes the lower, hard and rocky layers. the soil has less humus and is less fertile. Gradually the fertile land gets converted into deserts. the fertile land is called desertification. Deforestation also leads to a decrease in the water holding capacity of the soil. The movement of water from the soil surface into the ground is reduced. So, there are floods. The other properties of the soil like nutrient content, texture etc., also change because of deforestation.To protect our flora and fauna and fauna habitats, protected areas called wildlife sanctuaries, national parks and biosphere reserves have been earmarked. Plantation, cultivation, grazing, felling trees, hunting and poaching are prohibited there.Wildlife Sanctuary are areas where animals are protected from any disturbance to animals and animals habitat.National Park are areas reserved for wild life where National Park can freely use the habitats and natural resources.Biosphere Reserve are large areas of protected land for conservation of wild life, plant and animal resources and traditional life of the tribals living in the area.The government lays down rules, methods and policies to protect and conserve methods and policies. Wildlife sanctuaries, national parks, biosphere reserves etc., are protected areas for conservation of plants and animals present in the area. Biosphere reserves are the areas meant for conservation of biodiversity.Biosphere reserves help to maintain the biodiversity and culture of the area. A biosphere reserve may also contain other protected areas in A biosphere reserve. Biosphere Reserve consists of one national park named Satpura and two wildlife sanctuaries named Bori and Pachmarhi.The plants and animals found in a particular area are termed flora and fauna respectively of a particular area.Endemic species are those species of plants and animals which are found exclusively in a particular area. Endemic species are not naturally found anywhere else. A particular type of animal or plant may be endemic to a zone, a state or a country.Species is a group of population which are capable of interbreeding. This means that the members of a species can reproduce fertile offspring only with the members of fertile offspring own species and not with members of other species. Members of a species have common characteristics. Wildlife Sanctuaries like reserve forests provide protection and suitable living conditions to wild animals.Some of the threatened wild animals like black buck, white eyed buck, elephant, golden cat, pink headed duck, gharial, marsh crocodile, python, rhinoceros, etc., are protected and preserved in our wild life sanctuaries. Indian sanctuaries have unique landscapes—broad level forests, mountain forests and bush lands in deltas of big rivers.Satpura National Park is the first Reserve Forest of India. The finest Indian teak is found in the first Reserve Forest of India. There are more than one hundred National Parks in India.Rock shelters are also found inside Satpura National Park. Rock shelters are evidences of prehistoric human life in these jungles. Rock shelters give us an idea of the life of primitive people. Rock paintings are found in Rock shelters. A total of 55 rock shelters have been identified in Pachmarhi Biosphere Reserve. Figures of animals and men fighting, hunting, dancing and playing musical instruments are depicted in Rock paintings. Many tribals still live in the area.Project Tiger was launched by the government to protect the tigers in the country. The objective of Project Tiger was to ensure the survival and maintenance of the tiger population in the country.Project Tiger is one of the many species which are slowly disappearing from our forests. But, Pachmarhi Biosphere Reserve is unique in the sense that a significant increase in the population of tigers has been seen here. Once upon a time, animals like lions, elephants, wild buffaloes and barasingha were also found in Satpura National Park. Animals whose numbers are diminishing to a level that whose numbers might face extinction are known as the endangered animals. Survival of some animals has become difficult because of disturbances in some animals natural habitat.An ecosystem is made of all the plants, animals and microorganisms in an area along with non-living components such as climate, soil, river deltas etc. Red Data Book is the source book which keeps a record of all the endangered animals and plants.Red Data Book is maintained internationally by an organisation. India also maintains Red Data Book for plants and animals found in India.Migratory birds fly to far away areas every year during a particular time because of climatic changes. Migratory birds fly for laying eggs as the weather in Migratory birds natural habitat becomes very cold and inhospitable. Birds who cover long distances to reach another land are known as migratory birds.Reforestation is restocking of the destroyed forests by planting new trees. new trees should generally be of the same species which were found in that forest.If the deforested area is left undisturbed, the deforested area reestablishes the deforested area. In natural reforestation, there is no role of human beings.\n","0     A great variety of plants and animals exist on...\n","1     A great variety of plants and animals are esse...\n","2     Today, a major threat to survival of these org...\n","3     Deforestation means clearing of forests and us...\n","4         Deforestation disturbs the balance in nature.\n","5     If cutting of trees continues, rainfall and th...\n","6     Moreover, there will be increased chances of n...\n","7     This will lead to global warming as carbon dio...\n","8     The increase in temperature on earth disturbs ...\n","9                            This could cause droughts.\n","10    Deforestation is a major cause which leads to ...\n","11    Physical properties of the soil get affected b...\n","12    Removal of the top layer of the soil exposes t...\n","13         the soil has less humus and is less fertile.\n","14    Gradually the fertile land gets converted into...\n","15          the fertile land is called desertification.\n","16    Deforestation also leads to a decrease in the ...\n","17    The movement of water from the soil surface in...\n","18                                So, there are floods.\n","19    The other properties of the soil like nutrient...\n","20    Plantation, cultivation, grazing, felling tree...\n","21    Wildlife sanctuaries, national parks, biospher...\n","22    Biosphere reserves are the areas meant for con...\n","23    A biosphere reserve may also contain other pro...\n","24    Biosphere Reserve consists of one national par...\n","25    Endemic species are not naturally found anywhe...\n","26    A particular type of animal or plant may be en...\n","27    This means that the members of a species can r...\n","28    Members of a species have common characteristics.\n","29    Wildlife Sanctuaries like reserve forests prov...\n","30    Indian sanctuaries have unique landscapes—broa...\n","31    The finest Indian teak is found in the first R...\n","32    There are more than one hundred National Parks...\n","33    Rock shelters are evidences of prehistoric hum...\n","34    Rock shelters give us an idea of the life of p...\n","35           Rock paintings are found in Rock shelters.\n","36    A total of 55 rock shelters have been identifi...\n","37    Figures of animals and men fighting, hunting, ...\n","38    Many tribals still live in the area.Project Ti...\n","39    The objective of Project Tiger was to ensure t...\n","40    But, Pachmarhi Biosphere Reserve is unique in ...\n","41    Once upon a time, animals like lions, elephant...\n","42    Animals whose numbers are diminishing to a lev...\n","43    Survival of some animals has become difficult ...\n","44    Red Data Book is the source book which keeps a...\n","45    India also maintains Red Data Book for plants ...\n","46    Migratory birds fly for laying eggs as the wea...\n","47    Birds who cover long distances to reach anothe...\n","48    new trees should generally be of the same spec...\n","49    In natural reforestation, there is no role of ...\n","dtype: object\n","\n","***TextRank Summary***\n","\n","\n","***ROUGE Score***\n","\n","[{'rouge-1': {'r': 0.8333333333333334, 'p': 1.0, 'f': 0.9090909041322315}, 'rouge-2': {'r': 0.7625298329355609, 'p': 0.9565868263473054, 'f': 0.8486055727529547}, 'rouge-l': {'r': 0.8333333333333334, 'p': 1.0, 'f': 0.9090909041322315}}]\n","\n","***BART Summary***\n","\n","\n","***ROUGE Score***\n","\n","[{'rouge-1': {'r': 0.6291079812206573, 'p': 0.8903654485049833, 'f': 0.7372764738273209}, 'rouge-2': {'r': 0.5190930787589498, 'p': 0.7565217391304347, 'f': 0.6157112478271475}, 'rouge-l': {'r': 0.6267605633802817, 'p': 0.8870431893687708, 'f': 0.7345254421904569}}]\n","\n","***Combined Summary***\n","\n","\n","***ROUGE Score***\n","\n"]},{"output_type":"stream","name":"stderr","text":["\n"," 50%|█████     | 1/2 [01:59<01:59, 119.64s/it]\u001b[A"]},{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["[{'rouge-1': {'r': 0.931924882629108, 'p': 0.9232558139534883, 'f': 0.9275700884580531}, 'rouge-2': {'r': 0.8854415274463007, 'p': 0.8135964912280702, 'f': 0.8479999950089405}, 'rouge-l': {'r': 0.9295774647887324, 'p': 0.9209302325581395, 'f': 0.9252336398599224}}]\n","/content/drive/MyDrive/FYP/Dataset/Class8/Biology biology_class8_chapter7_coreferenced.txt\n","77\n","/content/drive/MyDrive/FYP/Dataset/Class8/Biology/Summary\n","/content/drive/MyDrive/FYP/Dataset/Class8/Biology/Summary/biology_class8_chapter7_coreferenced-Summarized.txt\n","Saved Successfully at /content/drive/MyDrive/FYP/Dataset/Class8/Biology/Summary/biology_class8_chapter7_coreferenced-Summarized.txt\n","/content/drive/MyDrive/FYP/Dataset/Class8/Geography\n","/content/drive/MyDrive/FYP/Dataset/Class8/Geography/afterCoref/geography_class8_chapter4_coreferenced.txt\n","Primary activities include all those connected with extraction and production of natural resources. Agriculture, fishing and gathering are good examples. Secondary activities are concerned with the processing of these resources. Manufacturing of steel, baking of bread and weaving of cloth are examples of this activity. Tertiary activities provide support to the primary and secondary sectors through services. Transport, trade, banking, insurance and advertising are examples of tertiary activities. Agriculture is a primary activity. Agriculture includes growing crops, fruits, vegetables, flowers and rearing of livestock. In the world, 50 per cent of persons are engaged in agricultural activity. Two-thirds of India’s population is still dependent on agriculture. Favourable topography of soil and climate are vital for agricultural activity. The land on which the crops are grown is known as arable land.Agriculture or farming can be looked at as a system. The important inputs are seeds, fertilisers, machinery and labour. Some of the operations involved are ploughing, sowing, irrigation, weeding and harvesting. The outputs from a system include crops, wool, dairy and poultry products. Farming is practised in various ways across the world. Depending upon the geographical conditions, demand of produce, labour and level of technology, farming can be classified into two main types. These are subsistence farming and commercial farming.This type of farming is practised to meet the needs of the farmer’s family. Traditionally, low levels of technology and household labour are used to produce on small output. Subsistence farming can be further classified as intensive subsistence and primitive subsistence farming.In intensive subsistence agriculture the farmer cultivates a small plot of land using simple tools and more labour. Climate with large number of days with sunshine and fertile soils permit growing of more than one crop annually on the same plot. Rice is the main crop. Other crops include wheat, maize, pulses and oilseeds. Intensive subsistence agriculture is prevalent in the thickly populated areas of the monsoon regions of south, southeast and east Asia.Primitive subsistence agriculture includes shifting cultivation and nomadic herding. Shifting cultivation is practised in the thickly forested areas of Amazon basin, tropical Africa, parts of southeast Asia and Northeast India. These are the areas of heavy rainfall and quick regeneration of vegetation. A plot of land is cleared by felling the trees and burning the trees. The ashes are then mixed with the soil and crops like maize, yam, potatoes and cassava are grown. After the soil loses the soil fertility, land is abandoned and the cultivator moves to a new plot. Shifting cultivation is also known as ‘slash and burn’ agriculture. Nomadic herding is practised in the semi-arid and arid regions of Sahara, Central Asia and some parts of India, like Rajasthan and Jammu and Kashmir. In this type of farming, herdsmen move from place to place with herdsmen animals for fodder and water, along defined routes. This type of movement arises in response to climatic constraints and terrain. Sheep, camel, yak and goats are most commonly reared. Sheep, camel, yak and goats provide milk, meat, wool, hides and other products to the herders and Sheep, camel, yak and goats families.In commercial farming crops are grown and animals are reared for sale in market. The area cultivated and the amount of capital used is large. Most of the work is done by machines. Commercial farming includes commercial grain farming, mixed farming and plantation agriculture.In commercial grain farming crops are grown for commercial purpose. Wheat and maize are common commercially grown grains. Major areas where commercial grain farming is pracised are temperate grasslands of North America, Europe and Asia. Major areas where commercial grain farming is pracised are sparsely populated with large farms spreading over hundreds of hectares. Severe winters restrict the growing season and only a single crop can be grown.In mixed farming the land is used for growing food and fodder crops and rearing livestock.It is practised in Europe, eastern USA, Argentina, southeast Australia, New Zealand and South Africa. Plantations are a type of commercial farming where single crop of tea, coffee, sugarcane, cashew, rubber, banana or cotton are grown. Large amount of labour and capital are required. The produce may be processed on the farm itself or in nearby factories. The development of a transport network is thus essential for such farming. Major plantations are found in the tropical regions of the world. Rubber in Malaysia, coffee in Brazil, tea in India and Sri Lanka are some examples.A large variety of crops are grown to meet the requirement of the growing population. Crops also supply raw materials for agro based industries. Major food crops are wheat, rice, maize and millets. Jute and cotton are fibre crops. Important beverage crops are tea and coffee.Rice is the major food crop of the world. Rice is the staple diet of the tropical and sub-tropical regions. Rice needs high temperature, high humidity and rainfall. Rice grows best in alluvial clayey soil, which can retain water. China leads in the production of rice followed by India, Japan, Sri Lanka and Egypt. In favourable climatic conditions as in West Bengal and Bangladesh two to three crops are grown in a year.Wheat requires moderate temperature and rainfall during growing season and bright sunshine at the time of harvest. Wheat thrives best in well drained loamy soil. Wheat is grown extensively in USA, Canada, Argentina, Russia, Ukraine, Australia and India. In India it is grown in winter.Ukraine, Australia and India are also known as coarse grains and can be grown on less fertile and sandy soils. It is a hardy crop that needs low rainfall and high to moderate temperature and adequate rainfall. Jowar, bajra and ragi are grown in India. Other countries are Nigeria, China and Niger.Maize requires moderate temperature, rainfall and lots of sunshine. Maize needs well-drained fertile soils. Maize is grown in North America, Brazil, China, Russia, Canada, India, and Mexico.Maize requires moderate temperature, rainfall and lots of sunshine. Maize needs well-drained fertile soils. Maize is grown in North America, Brazil, China, Russia, Canada, India, and MexicoBrazil, China, Russia, Canada, India, and MexicoChina, Russia, Canada, India, and MexicoRussia, Canada, India, and MexicoCanada, India, and MexicoIndia, and MexicoMexico.Jute was also known as the ‘Golden Fibre’. Jute grows well on alluvial soil and requires high temperature, heavy rainfall and humid climate. This crop is grown in the tropical areas. India and Bangladesh are the leading producers of jute.Coffee requires warm and wet climate and welldrained loamy soil. Hill slopes are more suitable for growth of This crop. Brazil is the leading producer followed by Columbia and India.Tea is a beverage crop grown on plantations. This requires cool climate and well distributed high rainfall throughout the year for the growth of This tender leaves. This needs well-drained loamy soils and gentle slopes. Labour in large number is required to pick its tender leaves. Kenya, India, China, Sri Lanka produce the best quality tea in the world.There are different versions about the discovery of coffee. In about AD 850, Kaldi, an Arab goat-herder, who was puzzled by the queer antics of his flock, tasted the berries of the evergreen bush on which the goats were feeding. On experiencing a sense of exhilaration, his proclaimed his discovery to the world.Agricultural Development refers to efforts made to increase farm production in order to meet the growing demand of increasing population. This can be achieved in many ways such as increasing the cropped area, the number of crops grown, improving irrigation facilities, use of fertilisers and high yielding variety of seeds. Mechanisation of agriculture is also another aspect of agricultural development. The ultimate aim of agricultural development is to increase food security. Agriculture has developed at different places in different parts of the world. Developing countries with large populations usually practise intensive agriculture where crops are grown on small holdings mostly for subsistence. Larger holdings are more suitable for commercial agriculture as in USA, Canada and Australia.There is a small village Adilabad in Ghazipur district of Uttar Pradesh. Munna Lal is a small farmer in a small village Adilabad who has farmland of about 1.5 hectares. Munna Lal house is in a small village Adilabad. Munna Lal purchases high yielding varieties of seeds from the market every alternate year. The land is fertile and Munna Lal grows atleast two crops in a year which are normally wheat or rice and pulses. Munna Lal takes advice of Munna Lal friends and elders as well as government agricultural officers regarding farming practices. Munna Lal takes a tractor on rent for ploughing Munna Lal field, though some of Munna Lal friends still use traditional method of using bullocks for ploughing. There is a tubewell in the nearby field which Munna Lal takes on rent to irrigate Munna Lal field.Munna Lal also has two buffaloes and few hens. Munna Lal sells milk in the cooperative store located in the nearby town. Munna Lal is a member of the co-operative society which also advises Munna Lal on the type of fodder for Munna Lal animals, safety measures to protect the health of the livestock and artificial insemination. All the members of the family help Munna Lal in various farm activities. Sometimes, Munna Lal takes credit from a bank or the agricultural co-operative society to buy HYV seeds and implements. Munna Lal sells Munna Lal produce in the mandi located in the nearby town. Since majority of the farmers do not have lack storage facilities, majority of the farmers are forced to sell his produce even when the market is not favourable to majority of the farmers. In recent years, the government has taken some steps to develop storage facilites.The average size of a farm in USA USA is much larger than that of an Indian farm. A typical farm size in USA USA is about 250 hectares. Munna Lal generally resides in an Indian farm. Some of the major crops grown are corn, soyabean, wheat, cotton and sugarbeet. Joe Horan owns about 300 hectares of land. Joe Horan grows corn on Joe Horan after making sure that soil and water resources meet the needs of This crop. Adequate measures are taken to control pests that can damage This crop. From time to time Joe Horan sends the soil samples to a soil testing laboratory to check whether the nutrients are sufficient or not. The results help Joe Horan to plan a scientific fertiliser programme. Joe Horan computer is linked to the satellite which gives Joe Horan a precise picture of Joe Horan . This helps Joe Horan to use chemical fertilisers and pesticides wherever chemical fertilisers and pesticides are required. Joe Horan uses tractors, seed drills, leveller, combined harvester and thresher to perform various agricultural operations. A grains are stored in the automated grain storage or despatched to market agencies.

Industries can be classified on the basis of raw materials, size and ownership.Industries may be agro based, mineral based, marine based and forest based depending on the type of raw materials Industries use. Agro based industries use plant and animal based products as their raw materials. Food processing, vegetable oil, cotton textile, dairy products and leather industries are examples of agro-based industries. Mineral based industries are primary industries that use mineral ores as Mineral based industries raw materials. The products of Mineral based industries feed other industries. Iron made from iron ore is the product of mineral based industry. This is used as raw material for the manufacture of a number of other products, such as heavy machinery, building materials and railway coaches. Marine based industries use products from the sea and oceans as raw materials. Industries processing sea food or manufacturing fish oil are some examples. Forest based industries utilise forest produce as raw materials. The industries associated with forests are pulp and paper, pharmaceuticals, furniture and buildings.Size refers to the amount of capital invested, number of people employed and the volume of production. Based on size, industries can be classified into small scale and large scale industries. Cottage or household industries are a type of small scale industry where the products are manufactured by hand, by the artisans. Basket weaving, pottery and other handicrafts are examples of cottage industry. Small scale industries use lesser amount of capital and technology as compared to large scale industries that produce large volumes of products. Investment of capital is higher and the technology used is superior in large scale industries. Silk weaving and food processing industries are small scale industries.Production of automobiles and heavy machinery are large scale industries.: Industries can be classified into private sector, state owned or public sector, joint sector and cooperative sector. Private sector industries are owned and operated by individuals or a group of individuals. Private sector industries are owned and operated by the government, such as Hindustan Aeronautics Limited and Steel Authority of India Limited. Joint sector industries are owned and operated by the state and individuals or a group of individuals. Maruti Udyog Limited is an example of joint sector industry. Co-operative sector industries are owned and operated by the producers or suppliers of raw materials, workers or both. Anand Milk Union Limited and Sudha Dairy are a success stories of a co-operative venture. The factors affecting the location of industries are the availability of raw material, land, water, labour, power, capital, transport and market. Industries are situate d where some or all of these factors are easily available. Sometimes, the government provides incentives like subsidised power, lower transport cost and other infrastructure so that industries may be located in backward areas. Industrialisation often leads to development and growth of towns and cities.An industrial system consists of inputs, processes and outputs. inputs, processes and outputs are the raw materials, labour and costs of land, transport, power and other infrastructure. The processes include a wide range of activities that convert the raw material into finished products. The outputs are the end product and the income earned from The outputs. In case of the textile industry inputs, processes and outputs may be cotton, human labour, factory and transport cost. The processes include ginning, spinning, weaving, dyeing and printing.Industrial regions emerge when a number of industries locate close to each other and share the benefits of each other closeness. Major industrial regions of the world are eastern North America, western and central Europe, eastern Europe and eastern Asia.Major industrial regions tend to be located in the temperate areas, near sea ports and especially near coal fields. India has several industrial regions like Mumbai-Pune cluster, Bangalore-Tamil Nadu region, Hugli region, Ahmedabad-Baroda region, Chottanagpur industrial belt, Vishakhapatnam-Guntur belt, Gurgaon-Delhi-Meerut region and the Kollam-Thiruvanathapuram industrial cluster.The world’s major industries are the iron and steel industry, the textile industry and the information technology industry. The iron and steel and textile industry are the older industries while information technology is an emerging industry. The countries in which iron and steel industry is located are Germany, USA, China, Japan and Russia. Textile industry is concentrated in India, Hong Kong, South Korea, Japan and Taiwan. The major hubs of Information technology industry are the Silicon valley of Central California and the Bangalore region of India.Like other industries iron and steel industry too comprises various inputs, processes and outputs. This is a feeder industry whose products are used as raw material for other industries. The inputs for Textile industry include raw materials such as iron ore, coal and limestone, along with labour, capital, site and other infrastructure. The process of converting iron ore into steel involves many stages. The raw material is put in the blast furnace where The raw material undergoes smelting. It is then refined. The output obtained is steel which may be used by other industries as raw material.Steel is tough and Steel can easily be shaped, cut, or made into wire. Special alloys of steel can be made by adding small amounts of other metals such as aluminium, nickel, and copper. Alloys give steel unusual hardness, toughness, or ability to resist rust. Steel is often called the backbone of modern industry. Almost everything we use is either made of iron or steel or has been made with tools and machinery of these metals. Ships, trains, trucks, and autos are made largely of steel. Even the safety pins and the needles you use are made from steel. Oil wells are drilled with steel machinery. Steel pipelines transport oil. Minerals are mined with steel equipment. Farm machines are mostly steel. Large buildings have steel framework. Before 1800 A.D. iron and steel industry was located where raw materials, power supply and running water were easily available. Later the ideal location for 1800 A.D. iron and steel industry was near coal fields and close to canals and railways. After 1950, iron and steel industry began to be located on large areas of flat land near sea ports. This is because by this time steel works had become very large and iron ore had to be imported from overseas.In India, iron and steel industry has developed taking advantage of raw materials, cheap labour, transport and market. All the important steel producing centres such as Bhilai, Durgapur, Burnpur, Jamshedpur, Rourkela, Bokaro are situated in a region that spreads over four states — West Bengal, Jharkhand, Odisha and Chhattisgarh. Bhadravati and Vijay Nagar in Karnataka, Vishakhapatnam in Andhra Pradesh, Salem in Tamil Nadu are other important steel centres utilising local resources.Before 1947, there was only one iron and steel plant in the country – Tata Iron and Steel Company Limited (TISCO). Tata Iron and Steel Company Limited (TISCO) was privately owned. After Independence, the government took the initiative and set up several iron and steel plants. Tata Iron and Steel Company Limited (TISCO) was started in 1907 at Sakchi, near the confluence of the rivers Subarnarekha and Kharkai in Jharkhand. Later on Sakchi was renamed as Jamshedpur. Geographically, Jamshedpur is the most conveniently situated iron and steel centre in the country.Sakchi was chosen to set up the steel plant for several reasons. This place was only 32 km away from Kalimati station on the Bengal-Nagpur railway line. This place was close to the iron ore, coal and manganese deposits as well as to Kolkata, which provided a large market. Tata Iron and Steel Company Limited (TISCO), gets coal from Jharia coalfields, and iron ore, limestone, dolomite and manganese from Odisha and Chhattisgarh. The Kharkai and Subarnarekha rivers ensured sufficient water supply. Government initiatives provided adequate capital for adequate capital later development. In Jamshedpur, several other industrial plants were set up after Tata Iron and Steel Company Limited (TISCO). several other industrial plants produce chemicals, locomotive parts, agricultural equipment, machinery, tinplate, cable and wire. The development of the iron and steel industry opened the doors to rapid industrial development in India. Almost all sectors of 1800 A.D. iron and steel industry depend heavily on the iron and steel industry for Almost all sectors of the Indian industry basic infrastructure. the iron and steel industry consists of large integrated steel plants as well as mini steel mills. the iron and steel industry also includes secondary producers, rolling mills and ancillary industries.Pittsburgh is an important steel city of the United States of America. 1800 A.D. iron and steel industry Pittsburgh enjoys locational advantages. Some of the raw material such as coal is available locally, while the iron ore comes from the iron mines at Minnesota, about 1500 km from Pittsburgh. Between these mines and Pittsburgh is one of the world’s best routes for shipping ore cheaply – the famous Great Lakes waterway. Trains carry the iron ore from Great Lakes to the Pittsburgh area. The Ohio, the Monogahela and Allegheny rivers provide adequate water supply. Today, very few of the large steel mills are in Pittsburgh. the large steel mills are located in the valleys of the Monogahela and Allegheny rivers above Pittsburgh and along the Ohio River below it. Finished steel is transported to the market by both land and water routes. the Pittsburgh area has many factories other than steel mills. These use steel as These raw material to make many different products such as railroad equipment, heavy machinery and rails.Weaving cloth from yarn is an ancient art. Cotton, wool, silk, jute, flax have been used for making cloth. 1800 A.D. iron and steel industry can be divided on the basis of raw materials used in 1800 A.D. iron and steel industry. Fibres are the raw material of textile industry. Fibres can be natural or man-made. Natural fibres are obtained from wool, silk, cotton, linen and jute. Man made fibres include nylon, polyester, acrylic and rayon. 1800 A.D. iron and steel industry is one of the oldest industries in the world. Till the industrial revolution in the 18th century, cotton cloth was made using hand spinning techniques and looms. In 18th century power looms facilitated the development of cotton textile industry, first in Britain and later in other parts of the world. Today India, China, Japan and USA USA are important producers of cotton textiles. India has a glorious tradition of producing excellent quality cotton textiles. Before the British rule, Indian hand spun and hand woven cloth already had a wide market. The Muslins of Dhaka, Chintzes of Masulipatnam, Calicos of Calicut and Gold-wrought cotton of Burhanpur, Surat and Vadodara were known worldwide for The Muslins of Dhaka, Chintzes of Masulipatnam, Calicos of Calicut and Gold-wrought cotton of Burhanpur, Surat and Vadodara quality and design. But the production of hand woven cotton textile was expensive and time consuming. Hence, traditional cotton textile industry could not face the competition from the new textile mills of the West, which produced cheap and good quality fabrics through mechanized industrial units. The first successful mechanized textile mill was established in Mumbai in 1854. The warm, moist climate, a port for importing machinery, availability of raw material and skilled labour resulted in rapid expansion of 1800 A.D. iron and steel industry. Initially 1800 A.D. iron and steel industry flourished in the states of Maharashtra and Gujarat because of favourable humid climate. But today, humidity can be created artificially, and raw cotton is a pure and not weight losing raw material, so 1800 A.D. iron and steel industry has spread to other parts of India. Coimbatore, Kanpur, Chennai, Ahmedabad, Mumbai, Kolkata, Ludhiana, Puducherry and Panipat are some of the other important centres.Ahmedabad is located in Gujarat on the banks of the Ohio River. The first successful mechanized textile mill was established in 1861. The first successful mechanized textile mill soon became the second largest textile city of India, after Mumbai. Ahmedabad was therefore often referred to as the ‘Manchester of India’. Favourable locational factors were responsible for the development of 1800 A.D. iron and steel industryAhmedabad. Ahmedabad is situated very close to cotton growing area. This ensures easy availability of raw material. The climate is ideal for spinning and weaving. The flat terrain and easy availability of land is suitable for the establishment of the mills. the states of Maharashtra and Gujarat Gujarat Maharashtra provide both skilled and semi-skilled labour. Well developed road and railway network permits easy transportation of textiles to different parts of the country, thus providing easy access to the market. Mumbai port nearby facilitates import of machinery and export of cotton textiles. But in the recent years, Ahmedabad textile mills have been having some problems. Ahmedabad textile mills have closed down. This is primarily due to the emergence of new textile centres in the country as well as nonupgradation of machines and technology in Ahmedabad textile mills.Osaka is an important textile centre of Japan, also known as the ‘Manchester of Japan’. The textile industry developed in Osaka due to several geographical factors. The extensive plain around Osaka ensured land was easily available for the growth of cotton mills. Warm humid climate is well suited to spinning and weaving. The river Yodo provides sufficient water for the mills. Labour is easily available. Location of port facilitates import of raw cotton and for exporting textiles. The textile industry developed in Osaka due to several geographical factors depends completely upon imported raw materials. Cotton is imported from Egypt, India, China and USA. The finished product is mostly exported and has a good market due to good quality and low price. Though The finished product is one of the important textile cities in the country, of late, The textile industry developed in Osaka due to several geographical factors has been replaced by other industries, such as iron and steel, machinery, shipbuilding, automobiles, electrical equipment and cement.\n","0      Secondary activities or manufacturing change r...\n","1      Industries can be classified on the basis of r...\n","2      Agro based industries use plant and animal bas...\n","3      Food processing, vegetable oil, cotton textile...\n","4      Mineral based industries are primary industrie...\n","                             ...                        \n","128    Location of port facilitates import of raw cot...\n","129    The textile industry developed in Osaka due to...\n","130    Cotton is imported from Egypt, India, China an...\n","131    The finished product is mostly exported and ha...\n","132    Though The finished product is one of the impo...\n","Length: 133, dtype: object\n","\n","***TextRank Summary***\n","\n","\n","***ROUGE Score***\n","\n","[{'rouge-1': {'r': 0.4789808917197452, 'p': 1.0, 'f': 0.6477174805473022}, 'rouge-2': {'r': 0.38394919168591224, 'p': 0.965166908563135, 'f': 0.5493597646186261}, 'rouge-l': {'r': 0.4789808917197452, 'p': 1.0, 'f': 0.6477174805473022}}]\n","\n","***BART Summary***\n","\n","\n","***ROUGE Score***\n","\n","[{'rouge-1': {'r': 0.3273885350318471, 'p': 0.9244604316546763, 'f': 0.48353715512142376}, 'rouge-2': {'r': 0.23787528868360278, 'p': 0.7240773286467487, 'f': 0.35810516794180336}, 'rouge-l': {'r': 0.32229299363057323, 'p': 0.9100719424460432, 'f': 0.4760112849426843}}]\n","\n","***Combined Summary***\n","\n","\n","***ROUGE Score***\n","\n","[{'rouge-1': {'r': 0.619108280254777, 'p': 0.9585798816568047, 'f': 0.7523219766556399}, 'rouge-2': {'r': 0.5300230946882217, 'p': 0.8345454545454546, 'f': 0.6483050799947733}, 'rouge-l': {'r': 0.6165605095541401, 'p': 0.9546351084812623, 'f': 0.7492260014234418}}]\n","/content/drive/MyDrive/FYP/Dataset/Class8/Geography geography_class8_chapter5_coreferenced.txt\n","81\n","/content/drive/MyDrive/FYP/Dataset/Class8/Geography/Summary\n","/content/drive/MyDrive/FYP/Dataset/Class8/Geography/Summary/geography_class8_chapter5_coreferenced-Summarized.txt\n","Saved Successfully at /content/drive/MyDrive/FYP/Dataset/Class8/Geography/Summary/geography_class8_chapter5_coreferenced-Summarized.txt\n","/content/drive/MyDrive/FYP/Dataset/Class8/Geography/afterCoref/geography_class8_chapter6_coreferenced.txt\n","The Government of India has a Ministry of Human Resource Development. a Ministry of Human Resource Development was created in 1985 with an aim to improve people’s skills. This just shows how important people are as a resource for the country. Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Vikas Yojna was started in 2015 aiming to train one crore Indian youth from 2016 to 2020. The objective of this scheme is to encourage aptitude towards employable skills by giving quality training to probable and existing wage earners. People are a nation’s greatest resource. Nature’s bounty becomes significant only when people find Nature’s bounty useful. Nature’s bounty is people with people demands and abilities that turn people into ‘resources’. Hence, human resource is the ultimate resource. Healthy, educated and motivated people develop resources as per Healthy, educated and motivated people requirements. Human resources like other resources are not equally distributed over the world. Human resources like other resources differ in Human resources like other resources educational levels, age and sex. Human resources like other resources numbers and characteristics also keep changing.The way in which people are spread across the earth surface is known as the pattern of population distribution. More than 90 per cent of the world’s population lives in about 30 per cent of the land surface. The distribution of population in the world is extremely uneven. Some areas are very crowded and some are sparely populated. Some areas are south and south east Asia, Europe and north eastern North America. Very few people live in high latitude areas, tropical deserts, high mountains and areas of equatorial forests. Many more people live north of the Equator than south of the Equator. Almost three-quarters of the world’s people live in two continents Asia and Africa. Sixty per cent of the world’s people stay in just 10 countries. All of people have more than a 100 million people.Population density is the number of people living in a unit area of the earth’s surface. It is normally expressed as per square km. The average density of population in the world is 51 persons per square km. South Central Asia has the highest density of population followed by East and South East Asia.People always prefer to live on plains rather than mountains and plateaus because these areas are suitable for farming, manufacturing and service activities. The Ganga plains are the most densely populated areas of the world while mountains like Andes, Alps and Himalayas are sparsely populated.: People usually avoid extreme climates that are very hot or very cold like Sahara desert, polar regions of Russia, Canada and Antarctica.Fertile soils provide suitable land for agriculture. Fertile plains such as Ganga and Brahmaputra in India, Hwang-He, Chang Jiang in China and the Nile in Egypt are densely populated.People prefer to live in the areas where fresh water is easily available. The river valleys of the world are densely populated while deserts have spare population.Areas with mineral deposits are more populated. Diamond mines of South Africa and discovery of oil in the Middle east lead to settling of people in Areas with mineral deposits.Areas of better housing, education and health facilities are more densely populated e.g., Pune.Places with religion or cultural significance attract people. Varanasi, Jerusalem and Vatican city are some examples.Industrial areas provide employment opportunities. Large number of people are attracted to Industrial areas. Osaka in Japan and Mumbai in India are two densely populated areas.The population change refers to change in the number of people during a specific time. The world population has not been stable. The world population has increased manifold as seen in the Fig 6.3. Why? This is actually due to changes in the number of births and deaths. For an extremely long period of human history, until the 1800s, the world’s population grew steadily but slowly. Large numbers of babies were born, but Large numbers of babies died early too. This was as there were no proper health facilities. Sufficient food was not available for all the people. Farmers were not able to produce enough to meet the food requirements of all the people. As a result the total increase in population was very low. In 1804, the world’s population reached one billion. A hundred and fifty five years later, in 1959, the world’s population reached 3 billion. This is often called population explosion. In 1999, 40 years later, the world’s population doubled to 6 billion. The main reason for this growth was that with better food supplies and medicine, deaths were reducing, while the number of births still remained fairly high. Births are usually measured using the birth rate i.e. the number of live births per 1,000 people. Deaths are usually measured using the death rate i.e. the number of deaths per 1,000 people. Migrations is the movement of people in and out of an area. Births and deaths are the natural causes of population change. The difference between the birth rate and the death rate of a country is called the natural growth rate. The population increase in the world is mainly due to rapid increase in natural growth rate.Migration is another way by which population size changes. People may move within a country or between countries. Emigrants are people who leave a country; Immigrants are those who arrive in a country. Countries like the United States of America and Australia have gained in-numbers by in-migration or immigration. Sudan is an example of a country that has experienced a loss in population numbers due to out-migration or emigration. The general trend of international migrations is from the less developed nations to the more developed nations in search of better employment opportunities. Within countries large number of people may move from the rural to urban areas in search of employment, education and health facilities.Rates of population growth vary across the world. Although, the world’s total population is rising rapidly, not all countries are experiencing this growth. Some countries like Kenya have high population growth rates. Some countries like Kenya had both high birth rates and death rates. Now, with improving health care, death rates have fallen, but birth rates still remain high leading to high growth rates. In other countries like United Kingdom, population growth is slowing because of both low death and low birth rates.How crowded a country is, has little to do with a country level of economic development. For example, both Bangladesh and Japan are very densely populated but Japan is far more economically developed than Bangladesh. To understand the role of people as a resource, we need to know more about people qualities. People vary greatly in People age, sex, literacy level, health condition, occupation and income level. It is essential to understand these characteristics of the people. Population composition refers to the structure of the population. Population composition know how many are males or females, which age group they belong to, how educated they are and what type of occupations they are employed in, what they income levels and health conditions are. An interesting way of studying the population composition of a country is by looking at the population pyramid, also called an age-sex pyramid.The shape of the population pyramid tells the story of the people living in a country. The numbers of children are shown at the bottom and reflect the level of births. The size of the top shows the numbers of aged people and reflects the number of deaths. the population pyramid also tells us how many dependents there are in a country. There are two groups of dependents — young dependents and elderly dependents. Those of the working age are the economically active.The population pyramid of a country in which birth and death rates bothe are high is broad at the base and rapidly narrows towards the top. This is because although, many children are born, a large percentage of many children die in many children infancy, relatively few become adults and there are very few old people. This situation is typified by the pyramid shown for Kenya.In countries where death rates are decreasing, the pyramid shown for Kenya is broad in the younger age groups, because more infants survive to adulthood. This can be seen in the pyramid shown for Kenya. Such populations contain a relatively large number of young people and which means a strong and expanding labour force.In countries like Japan, low birth rates make the pyramid shown for Kenya narrow at the base. Decreased death rates allow numbers of people to reach old age.Skilled, spirited and hopeful young people endowed with a positive outlook are the future of any nation.\n","0     The Government of

Summary***\n","\n","Climate refers to the sum total of weather conditions and variations over a large area for a long period of time. The elements of weather and climate are the same, i.e. temperature, atmospheric pressure, wind, humidity and precipitation. There are six major controls of the climate of any place. they are: latitude, altitude, pressure and wind system, distance from the sea (continentality), ocean currents and relief features. Due to the curvature of the earth, the amount of solar energy received varies according to latitude. As a result, air temperature generally decreases from the equator towards the poles. In Asia, this type of climate is found mainly in the south and the southeast. High mountains act as barriers for cold or hot winds; they may also cause precipitation if they are high enough and lie in the path of rain-bearing winds. The leeward side of mountains remains relatively dry. The hills are therefore cooler during summers. As one goes from the surface to higher altitudes, the atmosphere becomes less dense and temperature decreases. There is decrease in rainfall generally from east to west in the Northern Plains. This condition is known as continentality (i.e very hot during summers and very cold during winters). Ocean currents along with onshore winds affect the climate to the extent that a coastal area with warm or cold currents flowing past example, will be warmed or cooled if the winds are onshore. In general, coastal areas experience less contrasts in temperature conditions. The sea exerts a moderating influence on climate: As the distance from a place, the influence of the sea increases and the people experience extreme weather conditions. Thus it influences the temperature and rainfall pattern. Finally, relief too plays a major role in determining the climatic conditions of a place. On the basis of the generalised monthly atmospheric conditions, the year is divided into seasons such as winter, summer or rainy seasons. You may have observed that the weather conditions fluctuate very often even within a day. These variations have given rise to variety in lives of people – in terms of the food they eat, the clothes they wear and also the kind of houses they live in. Let us take two important elements – temperature and precipitation, and examine how they vary from place to place and season to season. The Tropic of Cancer passes through the middle of the country from the Rann of Kuchchh in the west to Mizoram in the east. The climate of India is described as the ‘monsoon’ type. Most parts of India receive rainfall from June to September. The annual precipitation varies from over 400 cm in Meghalaya to less than 10 cm in Ladakh and western Rajasthan. Despite an overall unity in the general pattern, there are perceptible regional variations in climatic patterns within India. In summer, the mercury occasionally touches 50°C in some parts of the Jammu and Kashmir Kashmir may be as low as minus 45°C. Thiruvananthapuram, on the other hand, may have a temperature of 22°C, whereas the mercury may be around 30°C at the same time. Seasonal contrasts are more in the interior of the Himalayas. On a winter night, temperature at Drass in Jammu or Kashmir Kashmir May be around 40°C while in winter, the weather lies sub-zero in some places of the Rajasthani desert, whereas in winter the temperature may be about 20°C and in winter there may be a difference between the temperature at Pahalgam and at the other places of Jammu & Kashmir Kashmir. The temperature of India has the following characteristics of tropical winds; Western region has the subtroponic winds; Central region has subtropic winds; Eastern region has tropical winds and Central region have subtropical winds; Southern region has tropic winds and Southern region have tropical winds.
